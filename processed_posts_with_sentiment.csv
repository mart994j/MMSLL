TPII,$TPII energy co-generation and eCell," Triad Pro Innovators ($TPII) is a leader in distributed energy generation, which is an energy production technique that employs small-scale technologies (e.g. solar panels, wind or other generators) to produce greener or renewable electricity on-site. Triad Pro’s small-scale, localized, distributed generators provide lower cost electricity and higher power reliability compared to their outdated counterparts.

Their generators drive small power plants to provide energy onsite with little reliance on the distribution and transmission grid. Larger, centralized power plants often run on coal, oil, or nuclear power, and are frequently located far from the end users. This means longer transmission distances, greenhouse gas emissions, production of nuclear waste, and serious potential for power loss through transporting energy over long distances.

Triad Pro Innovators, in its Energy Production division, owns and operates distributed combined heat and power (CHP) energy projects that are fueled by clean-burning natural gas. These units are located onsite at customers’ facilities and they produce electricity, as well as heat, and/or chilled water under long-term multi-year contracts. Co-generation makes two or three uses of a single burn of clean fuel, lowering emissions and increasing efficiency far beyond traditional power plants.

$TPII is extremely undervalued at $0.02/share and &lt;$1 million market cap. The future with their co-generation and eCell technology is bright and they are developing additional applications as we speak. This one has big room for growth.",None,1599216720,2,2,POSITIVE,0.9957238435745239
TPII,$TPII eCell is going to be a game changer,"Triad Pro eCell

The Triad Pro eCell is the future of energy storage.  It is a revolutionary storage system that replaces toxic batteries and is eco-friendly.  The eCell stores electricity quickly and charges in minutes.  It requires no maintenance or routine replacement and lasts for decades.

Global demand for renewable battery storage is at an all-time high and emerging rapidly. For many industries, the Triad Pro eCells offer a viable solution for standalone products when partnered with solar acting as the main charge.

Certain industries such as farming, mining, oil production and military currently rely on diesel-generated electricity because they are located in areas where standard grid electricity is unavailable.  Triad Pro's eCell is the solution.

Here is one fully developed practical example:  https://triadproinc.com/spree/

$TPII is extremely undervalued at $0.02/share and &lt;$1million market cap.  43 million shares outstanding with only 16 million float.

ARCO,Arcos Dorados $ARCO Owns 2200 McDonald's restaurants in 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The cheapest stock I have ever seen.,"A few weeks ago I did some DD on Huttig (HBP). The stock doubled and within a week it received a buyout offer. It was an incredibly undervalued company and it was only a matter of time before the market noticed.

**Today, I bring you another incredibly undervalued company**

Arcos Dorados Holdings (ARCO) is basically McDonalds in Latin America and the Caribbean. They own, operate and sub-franchise all McDonald's restaurants (over 2200) in all of Latin America and the Caribbean. 

**This is a billion dollar company and it is trading like a penny stock at only $4.50. Sales last year were almost $3 billion and the company earned $80 million in net income. EBITDA was almost $300 million. **

**For those who might not know, Arcos Dorados translates to Golden Arches in Spanish.**

Quote directly from the Arcos Dorados (ARCO) [Investor relations page](https://www.arcosdorados.com/ir/company-overview/) 

&gt;""Arcos Dorados is the world’s largest independent McDonald’s franchisee, operating the largest quick service restaurant chain in Latin America and the Caribbean. It has the exclusive right to own, operate and grant franchises of McDonald’s restaurants in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries and territories with more than 2,200 restaurants, operated by the Company or by its sub-franchisees, that together employ over 100 thousand people""

Coronavirus has negatively impacted sales for the last two quarters, but the sales trends are improving and the stock is still down massively from where it was before the crisis. There is a ton of room for this stock to run higher.

**The catalyst:** The outbreak in Brazil and other LatAm countries is slowing considerably. These economies are starting to re-open. People are starting to line up for Big Macs and cheeseburgers. During the last conference call the company mentioned huge improvement in traffic and sales trends. Another very important point is that the fast food industry in Latin America is highly fragmented with many mom and pop restaurants. These restaurants were power-fucked by pandemic related lock-downs and most of them will never reopen. Arcos Dorados will gobble up all this business and consolidate their hold on the Latin American and Caribbean market. Long term, the pandemic probably is a major boost for the company. 

**The play:** The stock trades at only at $4.50. These shares are on heavy discount. I think the stock should be trading considerably higher and the average Yahoo analyst estimate is $6.10. The September options ($5 strike) are trading at only 10 cents, and the IV for the September calls is under 60, so you are not overpaying for volatility. I think the calls and the shares will increase in value considerably. But still, for safety, I always recommend sticking with common shares when dealing with a penny stock.

*Disclaimer: I'm not pumping this stock, but I can clearly see huge value. I own 25,000 shares, which is a small portion of my portfolio. Do your own due diligence. Remember, the name of the game is to make money. If the stock shoots to $8, remember to bank some profits because nothing is ever 100% certain. But this company is pretty solid. It's a massive operation with over 2200 restaurants. It is not like some biotech company with 5 employees, or a speculative mining play.* **It's freaking the Latin American McDonald's corporation.**",Research,1598348224,75,201,POSITIVE,0.9921801090240479

Minerva neurosciences (NERV) failed their phase 3 trial for their schizophrenia drug roluperidone but are repealing the decision due to how the COVID-19 has made an impact on their phase 3 trial. All the way up to their phase 3 trial it has been statistically significant from placebos. They are also planning to shrink the amount of testing sites one can only assume because the standard deviations between statistical significance in certain areas was off well.. significantly. One can only assume that one of two things happen here. Some testing sites have monetary incentive to insure this product doesn't make it to the market, or COVID-19 was to fault here. Either way Minerva Neurosciences has wised up to the idea that these could be possibilities, and are narrowing how many hands are in the pot if given the secknd round of phase 3 trials. 

Now for my TA at a current share price of $3.13 the stock is currently oversold and giving me extreme bullish signals to the upside. Major resistances when in the 3.45 - 3.50 range.

NEXT,IS THIS THE NEXT TRVN?,"Hello reddit family. I am sharing some insight on another stock that I believe will have similar success as TRVN did. I played TRVN from $2.00-$3.5 and had some awesome profits from it. Hugh Henne on twitter introduced me to TRVN and yet again he hit out of the park. This new play is also a PDUFA run up just as TRVN was.

# LPCN!!

Float- 46 million **(HALF THE FLOAT OF TRVN)**

52 week low- .301

52 week high- 3.45

Market Cap- 88 million

Avg. Daily Volume- 2.5 million

Today’s Volume (8/7)- 3.5 million

**Why are we investing in LPCN?**

· I am playing LPCN for the run-up to their PDUFA on August 28th

· Entry- 1.80

· Target- 2.50-3+

· DO NOT PLAN ON HOLDING THRU VOTE

o I am only playing the run-up for this drug because it is riskier in my opinion than TRVN

o Evaluate your own risk, do some research, and then decide if you will hold through the vote or not

**What is a PDUFA?**

· “PDUFA dates are deadlines by which the FDA must review new drug applications”

What drug does LPCN have?

· TLANDO

o For men with low testosterone

o “TLANDO™ is an oral testosterone replacement therapy product candidate containing Testosterone Undecanoate (TU) that is designed to help restore normal testosterone levels in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.”

§ [https://www.lipocine.com/pipeline/tlando/](https://www.lipocine.com/pipeline/tlando/)

o Advantages of Oral testosterone therapy

§ No risk of accidental T transference

§ Non-invasive, easy to use

§ Potential for higher persistence

o Survey was conducted and answered by leading endocrinologists and urologists

§ 94% believed that and Oral TRT would improve patient compliance

o 📷

**· Why is this drug needed?**

o Nearly 500,000 new cases of low testosterone are expected per year in the US as the male population ages

o Approximately 24% of men between the ages of 30 and 79 have low testosterone (hypogonadism). Based upon this prevalence rate and the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 estimate that there are 90.4 million men between 30 and 79 years old, approximately 21.7 million men in the US may have low testosterone

**TLANDO’s history**

· Did not get improved in May of 2018 and had four deficiencies in their product

· November 2019, LPCN was trying to get TLANDO approved and the stock price rose to over 3 dollars

· They were rejected and it drastically dropped to 30 cents

· “Lipocine Inc. (NASDAQ: LPCN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, announced today that it has received a Complete Response Letter (""CRL"") from the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") regarding its New Drug Application (""NDA"") for TLANDO™”

· A CRL is a communication from the FDA that informs companies that an application cannot be approved in its present form.

· The CRL identified one deficiency stating the efficacy trial did not meet the three secondary endpoints for maximal testosterone concentrations (""Cmax""). The CRL does not identify any specific issues relating to the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (""CMC"") of TLANDO.

o Is this good news for us? Well they did have to improve their product BUT there was nothing wrong with the chemistry of the drug which means it isn’t a HUGE fix needed

· ""We look forward to continuing to work with the FDA to bring the fixed-dose TLANDO TRT option to patients,"" said Dr. Mahesh Patel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lipocine.

· [https://ir.lipocine.com/2020-03-04-Lipocine-Announces-TLANDO-TM-PDUFA-Date-of-August-28-2020](https://ir.lipocine.com/2020-03-04-Lipocine-Announces-TLANDO-TM-PDUFA-Date-of-August-28-2020)

**So.. in 2018 they had 4 things they needed to get fixed and they tried again in 2019. They were rejected again and fixed THREE of the things but still had ONE thing needed to be fixed. Hopefully they spent this year perfecting this ONE thing that is needed to be perfected so they can be approved.**

**Money**

· The Company believes that its existing capital resources, together with interest thereon, will be enough to meet its projected operating requirements through at least September 30, 2021 which includes an on-going clinical study for LPCN 1144, compliance with regulatory requirements, including the Company’s NDA submission for TLANDO™

**MY PLAN**

· I plan on watching LPCN carefully

· As of now, I do not plan on holding thru the PDUFA vote

· I am playing the run up with hopes of it hitting my price target of $2.5+

· The PDUFA is over 2 weeks away so it may not start running hard until the week of the vote

· I plan on adding dips under $2

· Let’s see if LPCN can work some TRVN magic",Research,1597050790,238,575,POSITIVE,0.9895065426826477

I understand there is often artificial hype, and after doing more of my own biased research, I see extreme warnings of pessimism and volatility.

SLRX,$SLRX - a fresh new play," Why Salarius Pharmaceuticals (SLRX on NASDAQ) is a great play . It's early right now, and I'm sure you guys are looking for a play, so I'll try to keep this informative while not adding shitloads of text. I'll start off explaining what Salarius does, they're a company that makes treatments for cancer, here's a paragraph from their website: Our technology targets the epigenetic causes of cancer which is the study of the regulatory system that controls how genes are turned “on” or “off.” In certain cancers, the proteins that regulate gene expression become dysregulated and incorrectly turn genes “on” or “off,” which in some cases leads to cancer progression. Drugs that are able to safely modify the activity of these epigenetic regulators may correct the gene changes that are driving disease. Our technology may also apply to hormonal cancers such as prostate, breast, ovarian cancer and perhaps other conditions like leukemia. Salarius has also gotten a 3-year $18.7 million Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) New Company Product Development award. So as you can tell this company has a lot of potential, I'll now show you the short term play and after that the long term play. ***SHORT TERM: The short term play is actually very simple and low risk. Recently the company released a PR which you can read here:*** [***http://investors.salariuspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/salarius-pharmaceuticals-expand-clinical-program-target***](http://investors.salariuspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/salarius-pharmaceuticals-expand-clinical-program-target) ***, once this PR was released, the stock price had jumped over 80% (this was after-hours), but right after that there was an offering for $1.20 a share. This is because the news above was unexpected, and of course the company would need funds to expand their clinical program. The offering closed recently, and although the stock has not jumped yet, it will happen quite soon. Something similar happened with TNXP, the offering had closed, and the stock was showing just a small increase every day, but suddenly it jumped from 70 cents to above $2 at its peak. It is VERY likely that the same will happen with SLRX because 1. Recently there was good news and there's absolutely NO WAY it has been priced in 2. For the past 3 trading days the stock has been showing a slight rise, which is the exact same pattern with TNXP, which as i said before, rocketed 3. This is actually a good company, their program seems to be promising and the company has been constantly improving their balance sheet. They don't have much debt and they have a MASSIVE amount of cash on hand. The book value of this stock is about $2.30 and analysts have set high price targets on this stock 4. There's resistance at 1.50, after that the next resistance is 2.50.*** Now for the long term play, which expands on #3. As I mentioned before this company has been constantly improving their balance sheets and their clinical program is extremely promising. The average analyst price target is $4.43, and the company is estimated to grow 98% the next quarter alone. This company has been constantly improving their profit margin. If this company ends up being successful (which I am 95% sure it will be), then the stock could skyrocket, for example, CODX, when it was just a small company was trading at under a dollar, and it is now sitting at $28. I'm not saying that this will go to $28, but there is a VERY high chance that this company will make it to at least $5 by next year. TLDR: SLRX is an amazing play for both short term. I can't set a short term price target because short term PTs are often inaccurate, and often make people think that the stock will definitely hit said PT, however, for long term I can say that this company will easily hit $5 by near the end of 2021.",None,1596618356,333,801,NEGATIVE,0.9743218421936035

BSGM,$BSGM DD Covid Play August 4th,"  

$BSGM is releasing phase 2 data august 4th at 1pm on their drug combined with remdisivir.

Preclinical Study:  
 

“We previously reported that the IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) provides a dose-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Here, we report that a 4-hour pre-treatment of Vero cells with 2.5µM MMPD reduces the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 more effectively than REM at the same concentration. Additionally, pre-treatment of Vero cells with both REM and MMPD in combination reduces the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 to values below the detectable limit of our TCID50 assay. This result was achieved with concentrations as small as 1.25 µM MMPD and 2.5 µM REM. At concentrations of each agent as low as 0.31 µM, significant reduction of viral production occurred. This study provides evidence that REM and MMPD administered in combination might be an effective treatment for COVID-19 cases.”

[https://f1000research.com/articles/9-361](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-361)

this drug has been used on zika and many other viruses. MMPD has been paired with ribavirin and its effects are stronger when both are combined.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29126899/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29126899/)

Furthermore, MMPD reduces the virus production of ZIKV as well as several other important emerging viral pathogens such as Ebola, Lassa, Chikungunya, and Junin viruses. The inhibition can be reversed by addition of exogenous guanosine to culture media, consistent with the mechanism of action of MMPD as an IMPDH inhibitor. We also provide evidence that MMPD can be used in combination with other antivirals such as ribavirin and T-705 (favipiravir) to enhance suppression of virus production.

[https://www.kvue.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/covid19-antiviral-treatment-clinical-trial-coronavirus/269-715bd478-bc15-4417-ad80-9e916f8b69d1](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/covid19-antiviral-treatment-clinical-trial-coronavirus/269-715bd478-bc15-4417-ad80-9e916f8b69d1)

Antiviral clinical trial underway for new COVID-19 treatment

At St. David's South Austin Medical Center, some patients are being enrolled into a study for a new antiviral drug called Merimepodib.

""It was also shown to enhance the activity of another antiviral called Remdesivir, which is presently the standard of care from an antiviral standpoint with regard to treating patients with this,"" Dr. Robinson said. ""And so, this study is designed to evaluate this in humans and determine whether this is actually an effective therapy and is beneficial to patients that are suffering from COVID-19.""

While it's not being used to fight other illnesses, Dr. Robinson said he feels it is safe as it has been studied enough.

""There is a fair amount of human data with regard to this medication because it has been investigated in other viral infections. And so, you know, the preponderance of the data suggests that it is a safe medication to administer. So far, my anecdotal experiences would include the same,"" Dr. Robinson said.

Keep in mind, Phase 2 trials are designed to evaluate the drug's effectiveness in people with the disease or condition being studied and to determine the common short-term adverse effects and risks associated with the drug.

HUGE,"BGFV DD, HUGE short term potential","Just some DD that I thought you might all appreciate: 

BGFV a no brainer to run up 200% to 300% short term

BGFV is a west coast sporting goods retailer that is benefiting from both a revamp of the business and the covid19 pandemic. On the covid side gyms are closed and people are concerned about their health which is driving business for sporting goods. NLS ran from under 2 dollars a share to over 10 on this phenomenon. At the same time theaters, bars and restaurants are closed. So what do people do? They hike, they canoe and they engage in other outdoor activities.

At the same time they have been revamping their business strategy to be opportunistic buyers of merchandise. Think the TJ Maxx approach to sporting goods where customers get exceptional value rather than paying top dollar. This has led to improved margins in the business and as of last quarter exploding profits. 

BGFV's Q2 was just announced with the company earning a whopping 52 cents a share against a 6 dollar stock price. Normalized to remove one time gains the earnings were 39 cents a share. On top of that they provided absolute blowout guidance for Q3 and expect earnings next quarter to be between 1 dollar and 1.30 per share. Sales in July are already up 30% over last year. On top of that the company reinstated their dividend of 5 cents a quarter retroactive to Q2 so holders will also get a dividend of 10 cents a share.

The company is also now debt free with 38 million dollars in cash. As of the end of Q2 in June the company had 16 million in cash and 35 million in debt. That means in a mere month they have generated 57 million dollars in cash. The entire value of the company today? about 120 million.

There are really 2 ways to win here. First there is the possibility of the company getting remotely close to the valuation of other sporting good companies. SPWH for example has similar revenue numbers, modest debt and is trading for 6 TIMES the valuation of BGFV. If BGFV were to be valued at the same level of this similar business the price would be in the ballpark of 25 dollars per share.

The second way to win is the inevitable short squeeze on these huge numbers. There are over 4 million shares short as of the last reporting date. Institutions own almost half the shares, insiders own another 7%. That means all but about 10 million shares are in strong hands and half of the remaining shares are short against a company trading for 1/6th of its peers with an absolute blockbuster Q3 on deck, and generating cash hand over fist.

EMAN,$EMAN poised for huge gain tomorrow on $33.6m DOD Award,"DOD Announced Award on Friday but Company has yet to issue a PR so news isn't widespread .

Award is for increased production capacity -

### DOD Announces $33.6 Million Defense Production Act Title III Agreement with eMagin Corporation to Strengthen the Domestic Electronics Industrial Base

As part of the national response to COVID-19, the Department of Defense entered into a $33.6 million agreement with eMagin Corporation **to sustain and expand critical industrial base production** of **organic light-emitting diode (OLED) microdisplay**s capable of meeting high-performance requirements in resolution and brightness.

eMagin Corporation intends to replace and update single-point-of-failure and aging equipment to reduce production downtime and increase yield and throughput.  The increased production will ensure the U.S. government continues to have access to this sole domestic supplier of high-performance OLED microdisplays for use in a variety of military applications.

Using funds authorized and appropriated under the CARES Act, this DPA Title III investment will offset financial distress brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and enable eMagin Corporation to retain current staff and create 14 new jobs made up of engineers, maintenance technicians, and manufacturing personnel.

eMagin Corporation’s headquarters and manufacturing plant located in Hopewell Junction, New York is the principle place of performance.

GNCA,A thorough DD on $GNCA,"**What is $GNCA?**
  * Genocea’s mission is to help conquer cancer through targeted vaccines and immunotherapies
  * [Using their revolutionary ATLAS platform](https://www.genocea.com/) to identify true T cell antigens, they are creating new lifelines for cancer patients by listening to and learning from the immune system.


**What is the ATLAS Platform?**
  * In essence, this platform developed &amp; used by $GNCA is meant for ""T-Cell Revolution""
  * In the past several years, new therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and adoptive cell therapies like chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-Ts) have offered new hope to millions of people suffering from cancer.
  * ICI therapies “take the brakes” off T cells, a form of white blood cell that can kill tumors. By taking the brakes off, these drugs help overcome natural barriers erected by cancers to prevent our own immune system and in particular, our T cells, from fighting cancer.
  * These new therapies herald future therapies employing T cells to attack tumors with ever greater accuracy.
  * Genocea uses a patient’s own T cell immune response machinery to identify optimal antigens. They can thereby develop a per-patient tumor-specific immune response profile. They use this profile to identify truly relevant antigens for each patient.
  *Their ATLAS technology platform works as follows:
   * The ATLAS Platform works by having polypeptides corresponding to each identified mutation from a patient’s tumor are delivered individually into their antigen presenting cells (APCs), which then process and present the peptides on the cell’s surface where they can be recognized by T cells. If a T cell recognizes and binds to the peptide, a cytokine response will be triggered, which we measure to determine whether the candidate is a true antigen, eliciting a stimulatory immune response, or an Inhibigen™, driving inhibitory T cell responses.


**What is their main pipeline?**
  * [Their main pipeline](https://www.genocea.com/pipeline) is lead cancer vaccine candidate, GEN-009
  * Their other pipelines are :
   * GEN-011
   * GEN-010


**What is GEN-009?**
  * It is known as their Neoantigen cancer vaccine program.
  * Neoantigens are personalized tumor mutations that are seen as “foreign” by an individual’s immune system. A personalized vaccine, therefore, targets these neoantigens, “educating” the immune system to find and kill the tumor
  * GEN-009, is a personalized cancer vaccine that uses our proprietary ATLAS platform to optimize target selection by selecting neoantigens and excluding Inhibigens so that the vaccine has the best chance of targeting the right tumor mutations in each person. 
  * Once they identify the best neoantigens for a patient, a personalized vaccine, composed of synthetic long peptides paired with the adjuvant Poly-ICLC, is formulated and shipped to the clinical site. By including empirically confirmed neoantigens to which patients have pre-existing responses, we create personalized cancer vaccines to which patients’ immune systems are already primed.


**GEN-009 Clinical trial status**
  * they are currently evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of GEN-009 in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial (GEN-009-101) that consists of two parts:
    * **Part A:** A study of the safety and immunogenicity of GEN-009 as monotherapy in certain solid tumor cancer patients with no evidence of disease. Patient enrollment in this part of the study is complete.
   * Part B:** A study of the safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of GEN-009 in adult patients with cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma


**What is GEN-011?**
  * It is a Neoantigen adoptive T-Cell therapy program 
  * ACT or “adoptive T cell therapy” involves the isolation and expansion of tumor- or neoantigen-specific T cells to create therapeutics targeting patients’ cancers
  * In their GEN-011 program, they are using ATLAS to identify patient-specific neoantigens that stimulate that patient’s immune system and exclude Inhibigens and then isolating the T cells that are activated by those neoantigens. 
  * They believe their first-in-class GEN-011 approach could provide a number of advantages over existing methodologies such as TIL (tumor infiltrating lymphocyte) therapy or TCR (T cell receptor) therapy


**Recent Financials/Business Updates**
  * As of June 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $22.1 million versus $40.1 million as of December 31, 2019.
  * R&amp;D expenses were $8.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2019.
  * Net loss was $11.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $6.5 million for the same period in 2019
  * Entered into an MTA and exclusive license option with Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd. (“Shionogi”) to develop a novel HSV-2 vaccine using Genocea’s proprietary HSV-2 antigens from the GEN-003 program, which the company discontinued in 2017.
  * Final terms of the license agreement will be based on results of the MTA evaluation and overall diligence. If licensed, Shionogi will assume responsibility for global development and commercialization of the HSV-2 vaccine product.
  * Genocea expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents inclusive of the private placement proceeds are sufficient to support its operations to mid-2022.

**Risks/Negatives of the business**
  * As stated on their 10-Q/10-Ks:
   * ""A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, has and may in the future adversely affect our business.""
   * ""We cannot be certain that we will be successful in advancing GEN-009 or GEN-011 through clinical development, obtaining regulatory approval for either product candidate, or commercializing either product candidate or any of our future product candidates.""
   * ""We are substantially dependent on the success of the clinical development of GEN-009, our only product candidate currently in active clinical trials. Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize the GEN-009 vaccine, or any significant delays in doing so, will have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations and financial condition.""
   * ""Because our active product candidate is in an early stage of clinical development, there is a high risk of failure, and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating product revenue.""
   * ""If we do not obtain regulatory approval for our current and future product candidates, our business will be adversely affected.""
   * ""If we fail to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States, we will not be able to market our products in those jurisdictions.""
   * ""We may not be successful in establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products""
   * ""If we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.""
   * ""Our future commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.""
  * ""If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.""

**Events to positively impact remaining quarters, Q3-Q4 of 2020**
  * On May 19th 2020, [$GNCA Announced](https://ir.genocea.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genocea-announces-material-transfer-and-license-option-agreement) it has entered into a material transfer agreement (MTA) and exclusive license option with Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd. to develop a novel HSV-2 vaccine using Genocea’s proprietary HSV-2 antigens from the GEN-003 program, which the company discontinued in 2017. 
   * Under the terms of the agreement, Shionogi will pay $2 million for the exclusive option to evaluate the HSV-2 antigens and to negotiate a license prior to expiration of the MTA. Upon exercise of Shionogi’s option, terms of the license are expected to include an upfront payment, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as tiered royalties. Final terms of the license agreement will be based on results of the MTA evaluation and overall diligence. If licensed, Shionogi will assume responsibility for global development and commercialization of the HSV-2 vaccine product.
  * On May 29th 2020, [$GNCA presented](https://ir.genocea.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genocea-presents-updated-long-term-safety-immunogenicity-and) updated durability, safety and immunogenicity clinical data from Part A of its ongoing Phase 1/2a trial for GEN-009, the company’s lead neoantigen vaccine candidate.
   * Data show immune responses occur rapidly after only two vaccinations and can be sustained for more than one year
   * Part B is exploring the vaccine's ability to reduce tumor size beyond the standard-of-care therapy alone
  * On June 15th 2020, [$GNCA Announced](https://ir.genocea.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genocea-files-ind-application-gen-011-t-cell-therapy-designed) the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application with the FDA to begin a Phase 1/2a clinical study of GEN-011 in a range of tumor types, with a focus on patients who have failed standard-of-care checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
   * The GEN-011 trial will evaluate patient safety, T cell proliferation and persistence, and clinical activity, with preliminary data expected mid-2021.
  * On June 22nd 2020, [$GNCA Presented](https://ir.genocea.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genocea-present-data-reveal-new-understanding-atlastm-identified) preclinical data that offers new and important insights into the biology and behavior of inhibitory neoantigens (Inhibigens™)  at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Virtual Annual Meeting.
   * The findings build on previous research presented at SITC 2019 which demonstrated that the presence of an Inhibigen in an otherwise protective immunotherapy can completely reverse anti-tumor responses.
   * In the preclinical study, pro-tumor Inhibigen effects were found to be correlated with an increasingly immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), including reduced TILs and enhanced expression of T cell exhaustion markers
   * Vaccination of tumor-bearing mice with a formulation containing an inhibigen impaired both tumor antigen specific and nonspecific T cell function by blocking their ability to secrete cytokines and kill tumor cells – an effect that abolished T cell responses to beneficial anti-tumor antigens.
  * On July 22nd 2020, [$GNCA Announced](https://ir.genocea.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genocea-announces-private-placement-financing-80-million) that it has entered into a private placement led by an undisclosed leading U.S. public investment fund specializing in life sciences as well as certain existing and new investors providing for the purchase of up to approximately $80 million of its common stock and warrants to purchase shares of Genocea common stock.
   * Genocea will offer 21.4 million shares of common stock and 12.2 million pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock
   * The warrants will be exercisable immediately upon issuance, in whole or in part, at an exercise price of $2.25 per share and will have a 4-year term.
   * Genocea intends to use the net proceeds from this private placement to fund continued clinical and program development of its neoantigen vaccine GEN-009 and its neoantigen cell therapy GEN-011, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

  * Link to [the Virtual asco 2020 presentation](https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/188863/abstract)
  * **Results:**
   * A patient diagnosed with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck had experienced successively shorter remissions but is now exceeding previous remissions and approaching nine months progression free with GEN-009.
   * The 40 doses given across patients have induced only mild local discomfort and no DLT.
   * Vaccination has generated immune responses against 99% of administered peptides, with both CD8+ and CD4+ responses in ex vivo fluorospot assays
   * To date, no patients have developed recurrent disease
   * GEN-009 identifies tumor specific immune targets from the individual patient’s tumor mutagens. Initial clinical data show that ATLAS antigen selection may be critical to the induction of broad, rapid and sustained immunity against tumor specific neoantigens

**Final Thoughts/Comments**
  * As I mention under every single DD I write up, please extend my DD by adding your own/researching on your own some more.
  * Hoping there's a morning dip, if so, I'll sell off shares to try to pick up 100 shares of this company.
  * Now that I have that out of the way, there's so much to this company that I like. 
  * What I love most about them is their current clinical trial success, especially with the data presented at the [virtual asco](https://ir.genocea.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genocea-presents-updated-long-term-safety-immunogenicity-and). And clearly I'm not the only one who believes in their tech, science and board members as just a couple of days ago they received $80M in funding. 
  * That being said I want people to know that other than their July 30th Catalyst, this stock for the most part is a **long-term-hold**
  * Now for me, I believe in their tech &amp; maybe because of my situation, I am more biased towards them. Their main asset, GEN-009, treats the exact cancer my dad has, the Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head &amp; Neck.   I actually discovered this company on accident, yesterday evening I was looking into any news on companies or anything regarding treatments for cancer my dad has and I saw this company. And as I dug into them I realized they do have, what so far looks like, to be a treatment that is yielding successful results.

AYTU,Load up on AYTU before 🚀 🚀 🌝 (DD included),"Before you read!


-	You can scroll down to the “SKIP HERE” line if you already know the history of $AYTU

-	This is my second DD ever so please give any type of constructive criticism on how I can improve these

-	I personally believe AYTU is a mid to longterm hold

-	As always, do your own DD

-	This is not a meme stock, do your due diligence and actually learn how much potential this stock has instead of shitting on it because you lost money




**What is AYTU BioScience? ($AYTU)**

-	AYTU BioScience is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics to improve the health of patients addressing significant medical needs such as hypogonadism (low testosterone), cough and upper respiratory symptoms, insomnia, male infertility, and various paediatric conditions. 


**Why is AYTU relavent right now?**

-	President Donald Trump was criticized for floating the idea of using ultraviolet light and injections of disinfectants to kill COVID-19 in humans. Aytu apparently took the President's musings to heart and has signed an agreement with privately-held Sterling Medical Devices to help commercialize a light-based therapy to treat COVID-19. The device is called Healight. [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/president-trump-asked-light-inside-142434136.html)


-	Aytu recently acquired exclusive U.S. distribution rights to the COVID-19 Rapid Test. This test can detect COVID-19 in under 2 minutes. [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aytu-bioscience-announces-china-export-154500597.html)

-	Aytu recently acquired Innovus Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharmaceutical company commercializing, licensing and developing safe and effective consumer healthcare products designed to improve men's and women's health and vitality. Innovus commercializes over thirty-five consumer health products competing in large healthcare categories including diabetes, men's health, sexual wellness and respiratory health [Source](https://aytubio.com)


**Aytu’s products:**

*FDA APPROVED:*

-	**Natesto**, the only FDA-approved nasal formulation of testosterone for men with hypogonadism (low testosterone)
-	**ZolpiMist**, the only FDA-approved oral spray prescription sleep aid
-	**Tuzistra XR**, the only FDA-approved 12-hour codeine-based antitussive syrup. 


*Other:*

-	**Healight** (*pending FDA approval*) is a UV light being work on at Cedars-Sinai that could be put down the tube of every patient intubated in an ICU since it kills/destroys so many kinds of viruses and bacteria including covid.
-	**AcipHex Sprinkle**, a granule formulation of rabeprazole sodium, a commonly prescribed proton pump inhibitor
-	**Karbinal ER**, an extended-release carbinoxamine (antihistamine) suspension indicated to treat numerous allergic conditions
-	**Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor**, two complementary prescription fluoride-based supplement product lines containing combinations of fluoride and vitamins in various for infants and children with fluoride deficiency


***SKIP TO HERE***
———————————————————————



Alright, here we go. Now that you have some idea of what AYTU is, let’s look at some *financials*, *data*, *technical analysis*, *news*, and *my thoughts*

**Financials &amp; Data**

-	Over the last 4 quarters, Aytu has seen an astronomical increase in revenue. Last years quarter on 06/30/19 they recorded total revenue of $1,716,000. On 03/31/20 it drastically increased to $8,156,000. Cash on hand went up 325% from December to March. Last 2 quarters it has beat earnings by a margin. It is also expected to beat earnings this upcoming quarter on 09/24/20. Their total cash went from $5,196,000 reported on 12/31/19 quarter to $62,265,000 for last quarter on 03/31/20. Aytu’s average volume is at 13 million which is good but it can definitely be higher once Healight gets approved. There are 117m shares of Aytu, 6.24% held by insiders, and 12% held by institutions. Market cap as of today is at 172.5 million dollars. I definitely believe all these numbers will be even higher for this quarter.


**Technical Analysis:**

-	Looking at the 1 day time frame Aytu, everything about the chart is bullish. MACD has just done the “golden cross” which is a sign that this stock is going up. For the last 3 months, Aytu has usually been between $1.38 and $1.70. It had 4 spikes up to $2 between April and May and that was because of ER, Healight, and the addition to Russel 3000. In the last week Aytu went from $1.25 to $1.55. Volume has also significantly increased in the last month. People are doing real DD on this stock and noticing how much potential it actually has compared to redditors calling it a “meme stock”. 


**Recent news:**


-	Aytu BioScience Announced Expansion of Nastesto U.S Commerical Team **(July 20th)** [Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aytu-bioscience-announces-expansion-natesto-113000617.html)

-	Aytu BioScience Announces Results from a National Cancer Institute Evaluation of the Company’s Licensed COVID-19 Rapid Test **(June 9th)** [Source](https://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4349484) 



**Important News:**

-	Aytu BioScience Announces China Export Clearance of Company's COVID-19 Rapid Test **(April 30th)**[Source](https://irdirect.net/prviewer/release/id/4308314)


**Some things to consider:**


-	Every bag holder of Aytu is waiting for FDA approval of Healight. If Healight can cure/treat Covid-19 this stock will 🚀 to the 🌙 

-	Bag holders are also looking forward to earnings because I can totally see it above $3 once it’s near because of how much money they are making with the Rapid Test Kits

-	Please don’t listen to the shittalkers of this stock. They’re just mad because they lost money on it. They are definitely rookies and don’t know how to hold. They also definitely didn’t do any DD on it and don’t know how much potential it has.

-	It has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.

-	It has a price target of $29-$55

-	Through all this we have seen over 1M shares being bought by the Aytu board of directors just in 2020!! Which states that the future of Aytu is in good hands, because the board believes in it. Proof—-&gt; https://imgur.com/a/3aBRxEh/

-	I believe right now is the perfect time to buy Aytu, its been holding strong over a dollar for months and once the q4 report is in, I personally expect it to be over $10 easily.


**My positions:**

-	5,000 shares at $1.51, will be adding another 5,000 if it dips under $1.40



Overall, Aytu BioScience is a strong buy for me. Everything is financially positive for this stock, numbers don’t lie. They are working on a possible UV light treatment for Covid-19 called Healight. They have over 500,000 Rapid Test Kits for Covid-19. Its a strong buy from all the elite analysts. It has a price target between $28-$55. Lastly again, stop listening to the shittalkers who call this a meme stock because they didn’t do any DD, they definitely lost money, and they just like to be trend hoppers and say what others say.

Most people will say that OCGN doesn't have anything in the pipeline; that's only partially true. These companies are still operating, and wouldn't stay in business if there wasn't much hope for their potential products. Follow the volume on a day like today!

TBLT,$TBLT is back in the radar,"Found this analysis at another forum (user Kevin at Yahoo Finance) noting what has happened with $TBLT recently. I agree with his bullish perspective, which suggests that the worst is (finally) over. 

\* 

Reverse stock in April is history and won't see another. Public Offering finished early last month and raised $17mil. These two things drove the price down. Now there's no where to go but up. They have the funds to increase inventory to support the Amazon sales, expansion in Mexico and so on. With hand tools and power tools coming 1Q 2021 they're finally moving forward and will continue a steady incline of 3-5 cents/week. That's at least 25% by end of next month. Under $0.80 buy in for Toughbuilt is pretty solid if you're o.k with waiting a few months to double up (Jan-Feb 2021). July 25th - this will not be under $0.80. IMHO 

\* 

I know some folks bought into $TBLT at the wrong time, but I believe the  stock has hit its bottom. The expansion into Mexico and other markets in Latin America will bring additional steady revenue for $TBLT. Amazon sales continue to be strong in the domestic market. If the company would provide additional guidance as to efforts to increase their presence in other outlets, like they did with Lowe's in the past, that would certainly provide additional confidence to stock buyers.

CREX,$CREX - Some DD,"Disclaimers: I bought 100 shares yesterday and the company I work for is one of their customers.

This company makes a product called Thermal Mirror. It's essentially a self check temp for businesses. It's a Android tablet that tells you your temperature.

It has face recognition of employees so it can send an alert to HR if an employee has too high of a temp. It also can tell if someone is wearing a mask and deny entry. All of these features can be turned on or off.

Soon they should add label printing so it can print out a label if someone passes.

Also judging by the attachments I wouldn't be surprised if in the future if it integrates into building security or a RFID time clock system.

Point of all this is they have a product that should be very versatile even after COVID is done.

In addition a partnership with Samsung was announced yesterday where Samsung's manufacturing will be using it.

LEDS,Could LEDS be a play?,"SemiLEDs is a company based out of Taiwan that manufactures chips for UV LEDS.

Back in April, Trump had the idea to treat patients with UV. I'm not sure if there was any correlation, but couple of weeks later, this stock jumped \~$1.50.

With recent developments concerning the aerosol transmission of the COVID-19, there is a serious possibility that UV light can be used to disinfect surfaces, such as trains and hospital equipment. Germicidal UV is already used to destroy SARS-CoV-1, MERS and other airborne disease, its effectiveness just hasn't hit mainstream media.

LEDS had a sudden jump earlier today and is slowly starting to come back down, but I think the future is bright for this technology. Any thoughts?

For reference, instead of linking in multiple tweets and wasting space, here’s their twitter page which I’ll be referring to https://twitter.com/T2Bio. I’ll be posting a quick summary and the tweet, feel free to fact check and do your own DD. Also, on mobile, so excuse the formatting.


May 26th tweet, they start to add a test kit for COVID-19:
“We understand the link between #COVID19 and #sepsis. We are adding a SARS-CoV-2 molecular test to our T2Dx® platform. At the end of June, we aim to offer the T2SARS-CoV-2™ Panel, enabling clinicians to ID COVID-19 infections, and secondary infections that can lead to sepsis.”

June 16th, adding 3 well reputable individuals to their board of directors:
“We are thrilled to add to our Board three new individuals, including Thierry Bernard, CEO, QIAGEN, Dr. Ninfa Saunders, President and CEO, Navicent Health, and Robin Toft, Founder and CEO, Toft Group.”

June 30th, announces the US launch of the test, which will help detect the virus responsible for COVID-19:
“We are proud to announce the U.S. launch of our new molecular diagnostic test, the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, which has demonstrated excellent clinical performance in the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for #COVID19! bit.ly/2YLJPMd”

July 2nd, it’s in stock, ready to ship, and the panel is validated in accordance with the EUA requirement from the FDA. (they submitted an EUA request to the FDA)
“Detect #COVID19 with confidence using the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, which enables direct detection of #SARSCoV2 from upper respiratory samples.  The panel has been validated in accordance with Emergency Use Authorization requirements from the FDA. “

So now all we’re waiting for is the FDA approval which is very likely coming in the near future (I’d say before or around August), and this stock will jump like any other stock, that has shot up after an FDA approval. 

The only difference, you’re going to be in it before the jump. As always, do your DD, fact check every information as you like, and only invest what you can afford to lose. 

I’ll add some of these for the people looking for the moon: 🚀🚀🚀",Research,1594827207,846,,NEGATIVE,0.9983128309249878

Recommending to all that want to get in on ground floor instead of chasing. Haven't seen it mentioned much on here so just putting on the radar. I think COVID plays will be hot near future, some already are but some haven't been discovered. Similar to EV market, the ones that haven't run yet will have their day soon.

Looking further I know that float is 50 million and the PEG ratio is currently at 0, and the current price level is 14% off its sma20 and 19.55% from its 50-day simple moving average. the RSI is pointing at 61 why the volatility over the past week is 12% and drops to a little under 12% over the past one month. the beta value is 2.16. **price target for the stock is $4.25 with highs ranging to $6.**

Cash on hand is 9.8 million dollars with operating cash flow of 31.31 million. Gross revenue 1.91 billion. Gross profit 527 million. 

It is rated as a buy from two different analysts(analyst don't mean much but a great sign).

It is estimated that 70% of college kids play video games and this will be launching initially at 250 different colleges. This will be a massive hit with payout to tournaments being scholarships. The advertising portion to make revenue(check added info at bottom) will be massive as well. While I do not think they will lead the way I think they will take their Fair chunk of Market and revenue. 

The last couple weeks it has exploded and is up 56% on the month and 25% Friday alone with so much left to go. With August approaching very quickly I believe that it will hit $4-5 within the next two weeks. 

This is a side Venture of a very reputable company and I believe they are moving in the right direction and very quickly. They won't be here long as news is making its way across the trading circles and was really catching on Friday.  I believe $4 is the cap I would personally feel comfortable entering but that decision is always independent of the investor. I just could honestly see this leaving Penny land and never returning.

Added info: According to Newzoo’s 2020 Global esports Market Report, “Total esports revenues will reach $1.1 billion in 2020, an increase of almost $150 million compared to 2019…The highest-grossing esports revenue stream worldwide is sponsorship, which will generate $636.9 million in 2020, up from $543.5 million in 2019.”

Just a fraction of that market will be huge ^

NOVN,Dd onn$NOVN,"**What is Novan Inc?**
  * [Novan is a biotechnology company](https://novan.com/about) that translates the scientifically-proven power of nitric oxide into innovative, first-in-class therapies.
  * Their proprietary platform advances research and development to improve dermatological, women’s health, gastrointestinal conditions and more.



**What is Nitric Oxide?**
  * [Nitric oxide](https://novan.com/nitric-oxide) has become one of the most studied molecules in human physiology.
  * A 1998 Nobel Prize-winning discovery lead to research confirming nitric oxide’s natural ability to:
   * Kill invading microorganisms
   * Regulate inflammation
   * Revitalize tissue
   * Prevent clotting
   * eradicate cancer cells
  * Nitric oxide, which is produced when the body modifies the essential amino acid L-arginine, is integral to numerous physiological mechanisms.



**What are the health areas $NOVN plans to address?**
  * **Dermatology:** Novan has created targeted technology with anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties for skin diseases with unmet needs
   * They recognized a lack of innovation in the dermatology space where patients still want novel topical therapies as alternatives to conventional antibiotics, steroids, biologics, or in-office procedures.
  * **Women's Health:** Researchers have demonstrated nitric oxide’s ability to inhibit viral replication of human papillomavirus (HPV) which if left untreated, high-risk strains can progress to certain cancers.
   * Nitric oxide therapy can be used as an additional line of treatment to complement preventative vaccines.
  * **Gastroenterology:** Numerous  gastrointestinal diseases result from undesired inflammation and/or an imbalance in the gut microbiome
   * They believe there is an opportunity with Novan’s nitric oxide technology to develop safe, well-tolerated product candidates that could be used in combination with or as an alternative to conventional therapies for some GI diseases.



**Intellectual property**
  * [Link](https://novan.com/research-and-development/)
  * Novan holds over 25 issued U.S. patents and over 35 issued non-U.S. patents in countries such as Japan, the EU 5, China, South Korea and more
  * These patents cover NITRICIL™ technology, as well as its formulation science and therapeutic uses
  * They have over 60 pending patent applications worldwide.



**Technology**
  * [Link](https://novan.com/technology/)
  * Novan’s innovative NITRICIL™ technology is the key to using nitric oxide as a medical treatment.
  * NITRICIL™ stores the gaseous species on large polymers, which allow nitric oxide to be applied as timed-release chemical entities.
  * This technology allows them to control the level of nitric oxide storage, the rate of release, and the molecule size for targeted delivery; The result is stabilized, druggable nitric oxide.



**What are their current Pipelines?**
  * They currently have [seven pipelines](https://novan.com/pipeline) in the works:
   * [SB206:](https://novan.com/pipeline/#sb206) Novan is developing SB206 as a topical antiviral gel for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus.
   * [SB204:](https://novan.com/pipeline/#sb204) Novan is developing SB204 as a once-daily, topical monotherapy for the treatment of acne vulgaris, a multifactorial disease with several mechanistic contributors to the disease pathology. Localized nitric oxide delivery may provide anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity from a single active ingredient.
   * [SB208:](https://novan.com/pipeline/#sb208) Novan is developing SB208 as a broad-spectrum antifungal gel for the treatment of superficial cutaneous fungal infections of the skin and nails, such as tinea pedis and onychomycosis.
   * [SB414:](https://novan.com/pipeline/#sb414) Novan is developing SB414 as a topical cream product candidate for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. A non-steroidal topical therapy that targets key inflammatory cytokines could address an unmet need for the 80% of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis patients with mild-to-moderate disease burden.
   * [SB206 for Genital Warts:](https://novan.com/pipeline/#gYsb206JfId0) Novan is developing SB206 as a topical antiviral gel for the treatment of viral skin infections, including external genital warts (EGW) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).
   * [WH504:](https://novan.com/pipeline/#wh504) Novan is developing WH504 for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
   * [WH602:](https://novan.com/pipeline/#wh602) Novan is developing WH602 for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).



**What Phase of clinical trials are each pipeline in?**
  * Both versions of SB206 &amp; SB204 are in Phase 3 of clinical trials
  * SB208 is in the middle of Phase 2
  * SB414 for Psoriasis is in the middle of Phase 1
  * SB414 for Atopic Dermatitis is entering Phase 2
  * WH504 &amp; WH602 are in pre-clinical trials

Statistical significance was not achieved for the primary endpoint in either B-SIMPLE1 or B-SIMPLE2, however multiple sensitivity analyses are supportive and consistent across both studies and support a potential path forward for the asset. The two trials are ongoing, awaiting 24-week safety data, thus the top-line results are for efficacy data only

**Catalysts**
  * This company does have a few upcoming catalysts in play, one of them being that they shareholders will vote no on a reverse split as they feel it will be over $1 soon &amp; that they will be mentioning the status of their COVID-19 studies that they began in March 
  * Based off of Ameritrade, next earnings report is on August 12th 2020

**Final thoughts/comments**
  * As always, please make sure you read everything I included in this DD such as the SEC filings, the corporate Presentation etc, just to make sure you're knowledgeable on the company before making any purchasing decisions on $NOVN
  * Anyways, as you can see, I did not add a quarterly financials portion as this stock is like $SHLL in a sense that they're not reporting anything at the moment, since they do not have a marketable product as of right now.
  * I love the fact that they do have multiple pipelines in phase 3 of clinical studies and the fact that they are now entering the COVID-19 sphere by conducting studies to possibly make an oral or nasal spray treatment for COVID-19.
  * Granted it's at a low price compared to my most recent DDs, I don't mind buying a few hundred shares in $NOVN, especially since the current price is at $0.49 and they just recently completed an $8million direct offering at $0.43 a share, which is why I can't see this price falling below than that price it was offered at.


Anyways, I hope this DD has been able to help out in any way possible. Take care &amp; hope you all have a great day!",Research,1594390411,952,,POSITIVE,0.998893678188324

**Final thoughts/comments**
  * As always, please extend the DD by adding more to it by making sure you read into everything I have linked &amp; making sure youre knowledgeable on everything I have written here :)
  * Now with that out of the way, I feel very good about Vanda Pharmaceuticals for multiple reasons.
  * $VNDA has beaten revenue expectations quarter after quarter for the last four quarters in a row.
  * On top of that, as I have mentioned in the recent Quarterly Financials, this company has improved sales in the first quarter by 22% compared to the first quarter a year ago. 
  * Not only do they have two relatively successful products that are continuing to grow revenue QoQ, they have a variety of Pipelines that are near their end of trials.
  * To add to that, their biggest pipeline which they are focusing greatly on right now is their COVID-19 treatment which is in Phase 3 trials with results coming during Q3 of 2020.


Anyways, I hope this DD has been able to help out in anyway possible! Hope you guys have a great day today :)",Research,1594390233,953,,NEGATIVE,0.8673570156097412

It's down to .90 and Bloomberg keeps putting out unconfirmed bankruptcy articles.  They did approve retention bonuses for the CEOs recently, which is never a good sign, but now the share price is getting quite low, especially considering the previous reverse split. 

Normally I would not consider trading in companies headed for bankruptcy, but it seems the trend this year is to send bankrupt stocks soaring.  Since there isn't a huge float due to the previous reverse split, it seems like this stock could make major moves with some attention.

The 'reports' about them closing stores are from Bloomberg and there has been nothing from the company or official sources.  ASNA is notoriously close mouthed and I doubt we'll hear anything until it actually happens.  

This company has quite a few good brands, but terrible management with zero PR, and do not seem to have transitioned enough to online sales.  It is not a company I want to invest in anymore, but RHers seem to buy anything that's going bankrupt, so why not consider this one?

Y’all expecting Newark before LaGuardia... I Believe it to be vice versa 🤨

- 54 days ago, on May 16th, the first  clinical lab job was posted for JFK, under “Jamaica, NY”. 

-48 days ago, on May 22nd, $XSPA dropped the JFK contract PR. 

- June 21st, is when Delta said it was stopping their airport testing at JFK. 

-June 22nd, is when $XSPA officially announced they were beginning their pilot at JFK. 

-17 days ago, on June 22nd the first clinical lab job postings were put up under “Queens, NY”, not Jamaica NY. 

-July 9th (today), is Delta’s last day testing at LaGuardia. 

Follow the trend...

-July 10th, XSPA should...

If that doesn’t hold true, XSPA announces contract 5 days after posting for jobs based on JFK timing. 

-5 days from yesterday, when Newark posting went up, would be Monday, which would make sense. 

Two possibilities, LGA tomorrow, or Newark Monday. Or both... Bullish


-Not to mention XSPA and Delta announced a partnership for their employees to get 25% for Xpressspa services at Atlanta. 

-Delta said it has partnered with Quest to begin testing, XSPA is partnered with Quest for testing as well... 

-If there’s no PR tomorrow this will dip hard, why would Dave Portnoy before close, buy 150,000 shares if there’s a possibility it drops 10% tomorrow?

-Why were the $5 calls for July 17th trading at 1,500 volume today?

-Why were the $7.5 calls for July 17th trading at 1,500 volume as well for the day? Yesterday they were both a few hundred. 

Follow the money. Connect the dots. That’s how you win

With Electric Vehicles becoming the focus of the futures think about all those dead/bad batteries these companies will have to get rid of. Not only does that battery lose all of its value when it’s dead it also COST the company a good amount of money to have someone dispose of it for them. This is where $CLSK will become huge! Their business plan to take those batteries and give them a second life as batteries for small-medium commercial building applications is both profitable and sustainable. This will reduce the need for mining of rare earth  minerals making it a sustainable strategy. 

They received a 2.9 million dollar grant and have support from Ford to focus on this idea and help make it a reality soon. The company’s is expecting $10 Million in revenue for 2020 which is a **222% increase** from 2019. 

On top of all that the chart looks fantastic. Look at the last month and notice how it has been stair stepping it’s way higher and higher with big dips on the way? That’s called a healthy stock!! 

The best part about all of this is that the stock just took a huge dip at the end of the day today. If you’re not already in, tomorrow it may dip even more which would give you the perfect entry point. 

For those of you who bought in high today, Selling in the $4.70s looks genius right now but don’t worry it’ll be well above that in the very near future.

EVFM,DD (sorta) for EVFM Phexxi,"For the sake of transparency, this is the first time I've typed up DD on something. Everything here is just information I've come across from when I first put this stock on my watchlist in May to now. The information below is more about the product than the company, although I encourage you to look into them further, as this isn't the only thing they're working on.

\----------------------------

On May 22 of 2020, EVFM received FDA approval for a new method of birth control which, in my opinion, is nothing short of revolutionary compared to what's on the market today. You may not know anything about female birth control and that's fine, because I'm about to try and educate your ass. 

**WHAT IS THE PRODUCT, WHY DOES IT MATTER**

The birth control product is called Phexxi. It's a non-hormonal gel that can be applied an hour or less before sex to prevent pregnancy and... that's it. There are a couple of reasons this is a big deal:

\- All existing female birth control methods (the pill, the shot, the implant, the IUD, etc) are **long term** options. If you miss a pill its inconvenient, if you miss two good luck figuring out whether or not its even effective at that point. The shot and the implant must be maintained over a certain period of time (3 months or 5 years, respectively) and a lot of women have issues with IUD's due to painful side effects and other reasons. The last one is particularly important. Spermicides exist, of course, but they have a failure rating of over 20%.

\- Other than sticking a sponge or a silicone cup up there, women only have **two** options for non-hormonal birth control. One is sterilization, which isn't widely preferable for obvious reasons, and the other is the copper IUD, which is known for painful side effects such as intense cramping and bleeding. This is an issue because many women can't take hormonal birth control, either because they're breastfeeding, want to avoid hormonal side-effects such as weight gain, or they simply have a body chemistry that doesn't allow for extra hormones in their system. This also goes for people who have survived cancer of the uterus or similar issues. It's also important to note that any hormonal birth control you take has a high chance of just fucking up your day/year. For example, it's pretty common for people to get the shot or the implant only to bleed constantly for up to a year, and this is considered normal. 

The product that EVFM is putting out is a solution to both of these problems that effect a significant percentage of the female population. Simply put, this is the only method to exist where a woman can use it, and then not worry about it. There's true beauty in simplicity. 

**WHEN IS THE CATALYST**

The product is hitting the market sometime in early September, according to a shareholder [letter](https://evofem.investorroom.com/2020-07-01-Evofem-Biosciences-Issues-Mid-Year-2020-Letter-to-Stockholders) (I recommend reading it) released by the CEO of EVFM on 7-1-20. However, also mentioned in the letter is a ""coming soon"" campaign, or a hype campaign around Phexxi for both doctors and consumers. There will also be a telemedicine support system released that's supposed to make getting the drug easier for consumers who need non-hormonal options. It was also stated that EVFM is trying to get Phexxi covered under the ACA, making it widely available to those who need it. 

I know a lot of you aren't long-term holders but if you're going to buy I would suggest doing so sooner than later. As I mentioned above, I've had this stock on my watchlist since May, and I'm kicking myself now for not having bought in sooner when it was in the 2.70's mid-June. 

It's important to point out that the CEO, 50% of the executive team, and 60% of the board of directors for EVFM are women. This matters beyond just supporting a female led company, it means that this is a product made for women and put out by women, which I believe says something about its potential success.

\----------------------------

Just so you guys know, I don't trade with large amounts of money. I started my RH account with $75 dollars, that's it, and I only own 4 shares of EVFM at $3.10 because of that. What I'm saying is, I'm not trying to hype this up for my own gains, for me this is more of a hobby than an intense trading game like it is for a lot of you. I really do believe that there's money to be made here if you're willing to put the time in for a longer hold, or you can wait for it to pop and try to chase it on the way up, I won't judge.",Research,1594217835,1012,,NEGATIVE,0.9995176792144775

With the new White House Executive Order soon to be enforced, foreign SATCOM and Telecom powers will be eventually removed from the United States. It's an issue of national security and can almost be seen as a political stride for dominance in the LEO satellite/ data communication industry. America likes to win. 

&amp;#x200B;

Leading up to today, the executives of GSAT have been loading up a massive amount of shares. At this point in time, they now own OVER 64% of all the shares, and another whopping 22% are owned by institutions such as Blackrock.

&amp;#x200B;

Globalstar has an entire fleet of satellites currently in the sky. You can watch them in real time here:   [https://www.n2yo.com/satellites/?c=17](https://www.n2yo.com/satellites/?c=17) 

[https://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/globalstar/](https://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/globalstar/) 

 ""The satellites are placed in eight orbital planes of six satellites each, inclined at 52° to provide service on Earth from 70° North latitude to 70° South latitude. The Globalstar constellation consists of 48 LEO satellites, with an additional four satellites in orbit as spares.

&amp;#x200B;

With the new ST-100 Chip, they not only get to take control of the skies, they are now able to be incorporated into OEM products such as our consumer hardware (laptops, phones, tablets, etc). One immediate example of this is their partnership with Nokia, which can take them to the next level as Gsat was just approved to purchase their own 5G band (n53).

And Jeep, who will be using them in their vehicles for long distance communication. This is powerful tech. And it is being employed trucking companies and freighters for those reasons.

GSAT,$GSAT - Additional DD - Webinar and Partnerships,"Below you'll see details on their new product they rushed out. The ST-100. Additionally, you'll see a screenshot from the VP of IoT talking about this product, the webinar, and how excited he is to announce partnerships. I truly think this is going to be huge. Notice the hiring posts on LinkedIn too from the past two weeks.

**Details:**

The ST100 is the latest satellite technology introduction to Globalstar’s family of Commercial IoT Solutions. Its design is intended for rapid development by 3rd party companies and brings a low cost, reliable, complete one-way data module to the IoT market. Simply add power, set the configuration and place in a mechanical housing for a working device suited for any market.

The ST100 board adds instant SATCOM capability to any OEM product with the Bluetooth and serial connector on the board and access to our APIs.

**Key Features include:**

* Globalstar Simplex modem
* GPS Receiver
* Embedded Satellite TX and GPS RX combined antenna
* Bluetooth Low Energy with embedded antenna
* Complete firmware package
* Nordic core processor for 3rd party firmware
* 3-axis accelerometer
* Battery charging and power control
* Power supply configuration options for: batteries; solar panels, line power
* Switchable between the embedded and external antenna
* Serial connector
* FCC, ISED, CE modular certification (pending)
* iOS and Android Apps for configuration of device firmware

The most appealing part of this device is that they’ve now made it available for OEM’s to equip, opening up its possibilities to be incorporated in more consumer hardware such as laptops and phones, or even larger-scale databases. This is the most important step forward, because now they are partners with Nokia, Jeep, and a few other brands to be equipped in their products moving forward. I like a business with a revenue stream.

You can even track their satellites here and watch them: [https://www.n2yo.com/satellites/?c=17](https://www.n2yo.com/satellites/?c=17)

Please stay tuned for this webinar. Insiders have been slowly accumulating shares and we are going to see why with the upcoming PR.

**Background**

Globalstar, Inc. is an American satellite communications company that operates a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for satellite phone and low-speed data communications. Meaning they do location services (GPS), data transmission (cellular), and sensor data (bluetooth low energy). Globalstar is partnered with Jeep and They have recently obtained and solely own some 5G spectrum, Band n53, for use with utilities. That last part is key.

&amp;#x200B;

**Timeline**

\*This DD/research is from the perspective of someone very familiar with the telecomm and connectivity industry. \*

***May 1st*** \- Executive Order issued from White House and Trump Administration to ban use of technology and components from potential foreign adversaries (China, Russia, etc.) that involve our power grid and utilities in the hope to prevent cyber attacks. Device manufacturers will now look to leverage USA and friendly nation based technologies and components which means a boost for companies like Globalstar.

**May 1st+** \- News starts to spread through the electronics and connectivity industry about the executive order. Many people see the trend and precedent established by this order and are switching their technologies even if they are not involved with utilities.

***May 18th*** \- Directors and Executives see the writing on the wall and load up on 200k+ shares.

***June 3rd -*** Globalstar rushes to announce their ST-100 chip which provides Cellular data, GPS, and Bluetooth, so they can capitalize on the market shift. Has FCC and IC certifications (USA and Canada). J

***June 17th -*** Globalstar and Nokia publicly announce and demonstrate LTE Band n53 (part of the 5G spectrum) at Technology Conference with focus on utilities.

***June 23rd to 28th -*** Globalstar goes on a hiring spree to design new modem(s) to capitalize on market shift and 5G spectrum. RF Front End Design Engineer, Firmware Engineer, Software Development Engineer.

**July 7th - Earnings to be announced. This is based on previous quarter earnings being announced on May 7th.**

**Financial**

Multiple Form-4s filed on- June 4th

Director - Keith Cowan, picked up 50k shares at $0.3078 and owns 248,908 total shares

**Summary**

Globalstar is a USA based company that provides asset tracking, cellular data and voice, and more via it’s own satellite system. These are critical in commercial markets such as transportation, construction, and utilities where items are very expensive or communication is critical, but hard to access. There is an Executive Order from the White House to remove all foreign adversary telecom equipment from our utilities and power grid due to risk of cyber attacks. This puts Globalstar in a great position as they recently pushed out their new ST-100 product AND bought 5G spectrum (band n53) to be used in utilities applications (which they showed off at a conference this month with Nokia. They are partnered with Jeep and have an upcoming earnings report for Q2. Insiders own 64% of shares and have been loading up according to SEC filings. The future seems very bright for this one and I’m hoping we caught it early. Possible medium term play too if you want hold.

Now it's my turn :)

Quick Note: I'm not a DD master, this is actually my first one so I would love some support + I'm no financial advisor if anything I'm just an autist to find the next 100%er. I'm just a 16 year old looking to find a good stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is $AYRO?** 

AYRO, Inc. is a U.S-based designer and manufacturer of purpose-built, automotive-grade, all-electric vehicles. They produce EV Vehicles similar to $NKLA $WKHS $SHLL etc. They have a market cap of ONLY $50 MILLION making it a micro micro market cap company.  They have more revenue than WKHS and a lower float than WKHS as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Goal of AYRO:**

 • ""Our AYRO electric vehicles help higher ed, corporate, and government entities eliminate volatile fuel storage and CO2 Emissions and reduce noise signatures by up to 75%.  

• Our electric vehicles are designed to traverse streets, narrow passages and campus walkways safely and use automotive controls for familiarity and ease of operation.  

• Compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle, AYRO electric vehicles have fewer moving parts and are up to 50% less costly to maintain. This means greater vehicle uptime and more efficiency across your fleet.  Texas-based AYRO, Inc., designs and delivers compact, emissions-free electric fleet solutions for use within urban and short"" 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why AYRO will 🚀🚀🚀 )**

\*This company has a PR coming soon I believe (Not sure please fact check)

\*Company merged with DropCar ($DCAR yes the Notorious one)  


\*They very recently expanded their electric vehicle manufacturing facility

&amp;#x200B;

\*MOST if not ALL EV Related stocks have completely went parabolic including:  
$NKLA   
$TSLA  
$SHLL  
$WKHS  
$SOLO

&amp;#x200B;

\*They have one of the lowest floats  [https://lowfloatreport.com/](https://lowfloatreport.com/) 

\*Volume is starting to REALLY pump. And people are actually JUST starting to spread, tweet, post Reddit stuff about this etc. Just yesterday there was nearly 20 million volume :).

\*Looking like the same **EXACT** pattern where AYRO went from $2 to $6 with ONLY a FRACTION of the volume it has now.

Video on AYRO if your interested  [https://twitter.com/ayroinc/status/1276562700752097281?s=21](https://twitter.com/ayroinc/status/1276562700752097281?s=21) 

Some of these are old news, but the reason why they haven't moved yet was because literally no one saw it. The volume of AYRO was barely holding 500k, just recently we've been getting 2+mil volume in fact on Thursday there was a 20 mil volume day.

&amp;#x200B;

**GREAT AYRO CHART:** 

\*RSI is picking up HEAT but it still needs fuel. RSI is at 56 which means its at a good deal, and it doesn't look like there will be a dip anytime soon 

\*MACD is crossing over last time it did this $AYRO went from $2 to $6! 

\*Squeeze breakout! This stock was having trouble climbing past that $3 zone and now that it's past that point its going to rocket! 

\*Volume picking up just like $GNUS $SHIP $TOPS etc. This volume came out of NOWHERE and could continue to go higher if there's more fuel to the rocket. 

\*Strong solid company. Brand new, and there having a PR soon too. 

&amp;#x200B;

**SHIT SIDE/CONS ON AYRO:**

This is a REALLY micro stock the Market Cap is literally in the $50millions. On top of this we don't know if EV Stocks are going to cool off this week. This is really important in my opinion, but the thing is **if people notice that AYRO is an EV Stock and notice it hasn't bounced yet FOMO will hit them like a truck because they wouldn't want to miss the next $SHLL $WKHS etc driving the price up**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another con about this company is the fact that they merged with the **NOTORIOUS DCAR** yes the shitty company. If I'm right about this there are LOTS of shorts/asks on DCAR (If that's how it works). Meaning that there might be a Resistance/Wall we would have to break in order for this thing to Rocket.

&amp;#x200B;

There is **SOME** resistance at the $3.30 mark because of DCAR, the MA 50 is at $3.35 while the 200 MA is at the $3.37 mark. But then again it has completely obliterated the 50 and 200 MA before when there was **NO VOLUME,** Plus using other indicators (RSI/MACD) it looks like we will absolutely destroy the $3.40 mark.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY FOMO MIGHT CAUSE THIS TO ROCKET**

Everyone wants to get a piece of the EV stock hype. Just look at:  
WKHS  
SOLO  
TSLA  
SHLL  
NKLA  


All literally went up 100%+ yet **AYRO has barely moved.** And by this logic people are going to see this and think ""hmm, I can get in early as hell because of how hot EV stocks are now maybe I should get in!"". And once it AYRO pumps a bit, and goes up, up, up, up people will literally FOMO the fuck out of this stock just like NKLA and WKHS. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Stocktwits AYRO went from having around a few hundred ""Watchers"" to 2000 on Thursday to over 5500 TODAY. People are JUST noticing this stock which is insane. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

🚀🚀🚀 TO THE MOOON!! 

Jokes aside this is a **REALLY Solid Play in my opinion**. It has really low float, great CEO, low market cap, more revenue than WKHS. And EV stocks are SO HOT right now. 

Chart wise, the RSI is curling up (Really bullish) and has a 56 meaning its a great deal, MACD is curling (Very Bullish), squeeze through and starting to push off the Resistance (50, 200MA) already. Volume picking up so much etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Solid solid NEWS, PR soon (I believe), 2x facility, merge with DCAR 

This price target of this stock is LIMITLESS it can literally go to $10+ and could be the next WKHS/NKLA if it gets hyped enough and we get more and more buyers. Overall I'm bullish

Video on AYRO if your interested  [https://twitter.com/ayroinc/status/1276562700752097281?s=21](https://twitter.com/ayroinc/status/1276562700752097281?s=21) 

Some of these are old news, but the reason why they haven't moved yet was because literally no one saw it. The volume of AYRO was barely holding 500k, just recently we've been getting 2+mil volume in fact on Thursday there was a 20 mil volume day.

&amp;#x200B;

**GREAT AYRO CHART:** 

\*RSI is picking up HEAT but it still needs fuel. RSI is at 56 which means its at a good deal, and it doesn't look like there will be a dip anytime soon 

\*MACD is crossing over last time it did this $AYRO went from $2 to $6! 

\*Squeeze breakout! This stock was having trouble climbing past that $3 zone and now that it's past that point its going to rocket! 

\*Volume picking up just like $GNUS $SHIP $TOPS etc. This volume came out of NOWHERE and could continue to go higher if there's more fuel to the rocket. 

\*Strong solid company. Brand new, and there having a PR soon too. 

&amp;#x200B;

**SHIT SIDE/CONS ON AYRO:**

This is a REALLY micro stock the Market Cap is literally in the $50millions. On top of this we don't know if EV Stocks are going to cool off this week. This is really important in my opinion, but the thing is **if people notice that AYRO is an EV Stock and notice it hasn't bounced yet FOMO will hit them like a truck because they wouldn't want to miss the next $SHLL $WKHS etc driving the price up**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another con about this company is the fact that they merged with the **NOTORIOUS DCAR** yes the shitty company. If I'm right about this there are LOTS of shorts/asks on DCAR (If that's how it works). Meaning that there might be a Resistance/Wall we would have to break in order for this thing to Rocket.

&amp;#x200B;

There is **SOME** resistance at the $3.30 mark because of DCAR, the MA 50 is at $3.35 while the 200 MA is at the $3.37 mark. But then again it has completely obliterated the 50 and 200 MA before when there was **NO VOLUME,** Plus using other indicators (RSI/MACD) it looks like we will absolutely destroy the $3.40 mark.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY FOMO MIGHT CAUSE THIS TO ROCKET**

Everyone wants to get a piece of the EV stock hype. Just look at:  
WKHS  
SOLO  
TSLA  
SHLL  
NKLA  


All literally went up 100%+ yet **AYRO has barely moved.** And by this logic people are going to see this and think ""hmm, I can get in early as hell because of how hot EV stocks are now maybe I should get in!"". And once it AYRO pumps a bit, and goes up, up, up, up people will literally FOMO the fuck out of this stock just like NKLA and WKHS. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Stocktwits AYRO went from having around a few hundred ""Watchers"" to 2000 on Thursday to over 5500 TODAY. People are JUST noticing this stock which is insane. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

🚀🚀🚀 TO THE MOOON!! 

Jokes aside this is a **REALLY Solid Play in my opinion**. It has really low float, great CEO, low market cap, more revenue than WKHS. And EV stocks are SO HOT right now. 

Chart wise, the RSI is curling up (Really bullish) and has a 56 meaning its a great deal, MACD is curling (Very Bullish), squeeze through and starting to push off the Resistance (50, 200MA) already. Volume picking up so much etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Solid solid NEWS, PR soon (I believe), 2x facility, merge with DCAR 

This price target of this stock is LIMITLESS it can literally go to $10+ and could be the next WKHS/NKLA if it gets hyped enough and we get more and more buyers. Overall I'm bullish

WKHS,QUICK CHARTING &amp; DD ON WHY AYRO COULD BE THE NEXT WKHS ($8+ (200%) )🚀🚀🚀🚀),"I just noticed [**stckpkr7000**](https://www.reddit.com/user/stckpkr7000/) sort of beat me to this thread. I was going to do this first but hey its whatever at least he's actually helping me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Check out his quick DD on $AYRO as well: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/hlycxj/ayro\_is\_the\_play\_this\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/hlycxj/ayro_is_the_play_this_week/) 

Now it's my turn :)

Quick Note: I'm not a DD master, this is actually my first one so I would love some support + I'm no financial advisor if anything I'm just an autist to find the next 100%er. I'm just a 16 year old looking to find a good stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is $AYRO?** 

AYRO, Inc. is a U.S-based designer and manufacturer of purpose-built, automotive-grade, all-electric vehicles. They produce EV Vehicles similar to $NKLA $WKHS $SHLL etc. They have a market cap of ONLY $50 MILLION making it a micro micro market cap company.  They have more revenue than WKHS and a lower float than WKHS as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Goal of AYRO:**

 • ""Our AYRO electric vehicles help higher ed, corporate, and government entities eliminate volatile fuel storage and CO2 Emissions and reduce noise signatures by up to 75%.  

• Our electric vehicles are designed to traverse streets, narrow passages and campus walkways safely and use automotive controls for familiarity and ease of operation.  

• Compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle, AYRO electric vehicles have fewer moving parts and are up to 50% less costly to maintain. This means greater vehicle uptime and more efficiency across your fleet.  Texas-based AYRO, Inc., designs and delivers compact, emissions-free electric fleet solutions for use within urban and short"" 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why AYRO will 🚀🚀🚀 )**

\*This company has a PR coming soon I believe (Not sure please fact check)

\*Company merged with DropCar ($DCAR yes the Notorious one)  


\*They very recently expanded their electric vehicle manufacturing facility

&amp;#x200B;

\*MOST if not ALL EV Related stocks have completely went parabolic including:  
$NKLA   
$TSLA  
$SHLL  
$WKHS  
$SOLO

&amp;#x200B;

\*They have one of the lowest floats  [https://lowfloatreport.com/](https://lowfloatreport.com/) 

\*Volume is starting to REALLY pump. And people are actually JUST starting to spread, tweet, post Reddit stuff about this etc. Just yesterday there was nearly 20 million volume :).

\*Looking like the same **EXACT** pattern where AYRO went from $2 to $6 with ONLY a FRACTION of the volume it has now.

PLAY,AYRO IS THE PLAY THIS WEEK!,"Copied/Borrowed from Stocktwits:

 [$AYRO](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/AYRO) saw someone predict $10+ this week. Having just gone public (via reverse merger recently) and the stock thus being in obscurity until now, this the closest thing to an EV/Clean energy pre-IPO that some retailers will see imo. If Rod (CEO) were to have done a true IPO and beat the pavement, could have been priced above $10 in this surprising EV market, as thats barely a [$150M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/150M) market cap. Bonus in this case is that Ayro is already moving into production mode and has partnerships with [$IG](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/IG) ([$12B](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/12B) mkt cap) and [$F](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/F) (for monetization of Autonomics software).  I’ve loved [$WKHS](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/WKHS) for two years ([$2B](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/2B) mkt cap), but even Workhorse only only has [$377K](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/377K) of annual revs at this point where-as AYRO has [$1M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/1M) in revs in 2019.  Yes, WKHS has [$377K](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/377K) revs in 2019 and a [$2B](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/2B) valuation &amp; AYRO has [$1M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/1M) revs in 2019 and only a [$49M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/49M) valuation. While a disparity is valid, not that massive. Both are USA startups and I have confidence in each, but again at the [$49M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/49M) valuation, am going heavier in AYRO at this point.

GENPREX $GNPX 

HQ: Austin, TX

Purpose: developing life-changing gene therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes through unique, innovative science.

PIPELINE


Our lead product candidate, GPX-001 (quaratusugene ozeplasmid) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), uses our unique, proprietary Oncoprex™ nanoparticle delivery platform, which delivers cancer-fighting genes by encapsulating them into nanoscale hollow spheres called nanoparticles, which are then administered intravenously and taken up by tumor cells where they express proteins that are missing or found in low quantities. In January 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for GPX-001 in combination with AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso® for the treatment of NSCLC.

SECONDARY

GPX-002, a gene therapy for diabetes, is the most recent addition of our licensed technologies. GPX-002 was developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh. Diabetic mice studies have shown that GEN-002 restored normal blood glucose levels for an extended period of time, which could translate to decades in humans. This gene therapy could not only become a new treatment option for millions of diabetic patients who need insulin replacement therapy, but it holds the potential to provide long-term effectiveness, or may even be a cure, for diabetic patients.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/amp/news/923341
CEO Rodney Varner confirms Aldevron and GenPrex relationship dating back to 2012.

GNPX was trading at .37 before it was FDA fast tracked in Jan 2020. That plus the following catalyst sent it all the way to $7. It has since dropped to the $3 area. I personally think this thing could be huge in the next 3-5 years. Or even sooner.

This year they have done 2 offerings for approx. $25 million combined to fund these trials. If the trials are unsuccessfully, this would setback GenPrex heavily.


UPON FURTHER RESEARCH:

The Aldevron Partnership will provide for production of TUSC2 plasmid DNA, the active agent in Oncoprex, at full commercial scale. Also, keep in mind Aldevron is building a 14-acre Gene Therapy Campus that will expand its manufacturing capacity by 10x. They will begin construction on this campus in August 2020. They plan to have it completed by Q1 2021. 

Also, I was able to find that the FDA Fast Track for GPX-001 in Jan 2020 is expected by GenPrex, to be fully approved by the beginning of 2021. This aligns with the time frame Aldevron intends to finish the 14-acre Gene Therapy Campus. Coincidence? Maybe. 

But upon FURTHER research I was able to find an [interview](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/amp/news/923341) with the CEO Rodney Varner, and in this interview he confirm that GenPrex and Aldevron have been working together to manufacture TUSC2 since 2012. 

They have been working on this for the past 8 years, with one of the TOP Cancer research institutes (UT MD Anderson) and are now FDA fast tracked. This very same technology is what they are planning to do with alpha cells in the pancreas to cure diabetes with the University of Pittsburgh.

Also, they are expecting to begin human trials on GPX-001 FDA Fast Track Mid 2020. We should expect an update anytime from now until August I would believe. 

Also, took a look at a few of the guys involved.

SOLO,"So here are my thoughts on SOLO so far, in case anyone isn't clued in, SOLO is Electromeccanica","this is just meant to eb a seed discussion since I obviously don't have the whole picture at all.

What I do see in SOLO, first to get it out of the way. a terrible name Electromechacanopiascopy might as well been the same for as catchy as it'd ever be. that could be a disadvantage.

Musk snared the name Tesla at a time when the works of Nikola Tesla were becoming more and more honored and recognized but now when you look up Tesla you have upsetting feelings. 

Regardless EV and then even AV are considered stepping stones into the future, if musk has it his way we'd live in a final fantasy 7 type world of extreme class stratification where the working class only has relics were left with to get by on. 

there was this question from someone I won't quote because it might change the context of this but, here's how it goes ""if you can invent something that would be the leading killer of healthy adults (not to mention horrible injuries, full disclosure my parents will killed in a car wreck and I'm sure we all know someone) it would destroy the planet, have cascading effects across the political spectrum leading to collusion agianst everyones interests, and it's mere existence seeks to preclude any other alternative would you agree that it's a good invention?

you have. it's a car-- the main life form in the US where more space is dedicated to cars than people (with the exception of corporate persons) 

before covid car fatalities killing 30 000 healthy adults a year seemed impressive.

we've somehow been conditioned into identifying with our cars as if they were part of our identities to the point where people who are going through a mid life crisis is synonymous with buying a race car. This entails the ridiculous act of pedaling an average 2 ton piece of metal to transport one person around, not to mention your car is essentially a gigantic ID card you drag around wherever you go and police do passively scan license plates.

Tesla among other nefarious acts of corporate whoredom intends to destroy public transport and privatize it beyond the reaches of those who need a means to get them and their kids to work while planes are arguably just as bad albeit safer.

SOLO falls into the same category as Tesla although they're going for more of a VW bug approach by making essentially the anti Tesla. This I actually do support as things are the way they are now and it seems like musk will continue to deny us levitating trains for as long as he can just like he killed the high speed rail project by siphoning 10bn tax payer dollars out of the common transportation grant pool.

SOLO doesn't technically make cars, they found a way to make something that works like a single passenger car with plenty of store space that falls within the category of a motorcycle minus the dangers involved and being an ev. So it's basically an evolved highway legal vespa.

This strategy not only keeps production costs down due to the much less rigorous certification but some other stand out advantages in terms of profitability is that as a single passenger car the company can keep pumping out the same thing over and over again and export it anywhere in the world because you don't have to move the steering wheel. It is also small light weight and basically just a more reasonable means of transport in terms of person to machine ratio.

I see this potentially be a fantastic commuter car but I also see the high likelihood of people using them as delivery fleets. Asians in particular I suspect will be all about the SOLO as is much of Europe because they don't have so much the car self identity culture we have and they're used to driving smaller cars without it affecting their masculinity.

cars in America are basically like guns but to broader group of people..

so the biggest resistance to it I would suspect would be in America.

so pros:

very fuel efficient

safe

not stupidly over sized

Ease of parking

affordable to manufacture and to purchase

great for fleet services

okay for  spontaneous rentals

SOLO is covid safe. 

(space left for others)

cons:

it's name is a mouthful. 

not so okay for spontaneously rentals since most people want a passenger. 

Americans in particular think they look weird and the word wussy comes to mind.

Canadian although they are in the midst of creating a plant here. (I wish people would aim for regions that need work like Ohio, f Amazon for doing that stupid city dance off and kudos to Cuomo and the city council for giving Amazon a rude welcome and farewell.

people will use them as stunt vehicles for fun which can possibly cause more injuries.

we really don't know much about them yet and so lots of questions about their comfort and safety linger. 

I do think the ability to out produce Tesla and other car companies with more affordable cars is a good solid niche so I personally think this is a good long haul investment.

BYFC,"$BYFC Huge Potential With Proven Facts, PR, and Stock Analysis","With Blackout Tuesday approaching, Many African American owned banks should see a spike incoming. There are a lot of factors that push $BYFC above the others which I will get into. The most important is that $BYFC is the poster child of what Blackout Tuesday wants to emphasize!

1) Beginning with the fact that Broadway Federal Bank (BYFC) is Minority Depository Institution. Meaning that 51% or more of the voting stock is **MINORITY** owned. A majority of the board of directors is **MINORITY** and the institution serves predominantly **MINORITY** owned communities. What also puts them over other banks such as CARV is that they serve to low income communities in Southern California whereas CARV is primarily in NY. According to Forbes, there are FOUR ""majority-minority"" states in the U.S. which includes California but not NY.

2) *RECENT PR (7/1/20)*: In the article linked below, Robert F. Smith ""The country's richest Black person"" went on to say the following.

&gt;Smith’s comments came after circulating a plan among CEOs that calls on big banks to capitalize on the financial institutions that cater to **Black-owned businesses** and entrepreneurial ventures. Smith called the process “reparative” capital in a keynote address he gave at the Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy last month. He pointed out that most Black communities have been shunned by large banks and they lack the capital necessary to build businesses and local institutions.

Mr. Smith also said “70% of African American communities don’t even have a branch, or bank of any type supporting them.”

$BYFC is all about pushing minority owned business and helping low income minorities in all of California and eventually the whole Southwest

Mission Statement

""The Banks's mission is to serve the real estate, business and financial needs of customers in undeserved urban communities with a commitment to excellent service, profitability and sustained growth.""

3) $BYFC STOCK ANALYSIS

According to InvestorsObserver's $BYFC received a rating of 98 and overall rating of 56. For those of you who don't understand what this means, a rating of 98 means that it scores higher than 98% of stocks in the **INDUSTRY**! A overall rating of 56 means it is above 56% **ALL** stocks! These ratings are a real tool that allows stocks to be compared to each other and $BYFC stands tall compared to others.

Competitively, $BYFC is the cheaper per share price when looking at CARV or UONE. This allows more people and multiple types of traders to enter!

4) Lastly, there was a HUGE spike for Blackout Friday. Jumped from mid $1 to $7!!!

June 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – Safe-T Launches the Perimeter Access Orchestration Fabric to Support all Remote Access Scenarios

Safe-T® Group Ltd. (NASDAQ, TASE: SFET), a provider of secure access solutions for on-premise and hybrid cloud environments, today announced the launch of its Perimeter Access Orchestration Fabric (PAOF) designed to take its leading Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution to the next level.

June 17, 2020- Safe-T Announces the Launch of New Product by NetNut: Data Center Proxy Network

Revenue up almost 200% this year,

Organizations today face a wide range of remote access scenarios and requirements, all of which must be addressed by a single solution, such as:

• Employees and third-party contractors accessing internal resources;
• Internal users connecting via the corporate network accessing internal resources;
• Remote access to cloud-based and on-premises legacy applications; and
• Integration of multi factor authentication (MFA) and identity awareness into all remote access scenarios.


On April 20, 2020, the Company reported a significant decrease of approximately 93% in its liabilities of a total of $8.23 million pertaining to the convertible debentures issued in April 2019 and in subsequent convertible loan transactions undertaken by the Company. On April 23, 2020, the Company retired in full its outstanding debenture debt, including redemption premium and accrued interest.- Zero risk of bankruptcy.

Summary:

Revenue is up almost 200%(before massive contract) from last year and this stock is currently showing a pennant bullish technical chart. This company will benefit from a second wave of Covid due to the need for Corporations that transition to work from home/ government also just announced their partnership, new software perfect timing. Get in for the moon!!

Further info -

Massive reach as a company 

New contracts 

Public float 1.7 million

No debt

Bullish for three months leading up to contracts

The fair value was reported at $2.25 a share before these contracts and its massive revenue and now is easily worth 3+. 

Covid has been going around in China since before December. This will continue with no end in sight and more companies will be looking to employ from home with cyber-security becoming a must necessity. 

They have contracts with massive intelligence services and you can assume if an intelligence service would trust the software so would any retail business. 

News transcribed : Safe-T a provider of secure access solutions for on-premise and hybrid Cloud environments, today announced that it has launched a unique implementation of the zero trust secure file access solution and was selected by a leading intelligence unit after successfully winning a tender process. The purchase order is approximately $225,000 and as for a Perpetual license with a one-year maintenance period.   CEO "" We are proud to be the first to introduce our zero trust SFA solution as a SMB proxy and to have been successfully selected over other file access vendors to provide our solution to a leading intelligence unit specializing both and cyber and security. These achievements are important milestones for us as they reiterate our mission to provide world-class, Innovative cybersecurity products which not only fit business and Commercial needs but which we believe are also perfectly suited to government and defense requirements. ""

They have not released the name of all the clients specifically and PR is in the pipeline I would assume to announce all moves as well as established and new contracts that were acquired by $SFET. This company has never been in a better Financial situation and moving forward they will continue to acquire clients and contracts at a rapid rate. 

This is a short and mid-range play that I see easily pushing $3 or more. I know some will take profits but I would personally hold until all clients and contracts are made clear as the extent is unknown and could be quite substantial. 

Although I doubt many of you will hold long term I can definitely see this company from $7-10 by EOY. 

Risks - 

Financially there is no risk here (money situation is stable) but as with any penny stock an offering is always on the table but I believe with the new contracts they have acquired they will not be looking to do such a thing at this time.

XSPA,Why People Need to Forget About $XSPA (lmbo I'm bullish btw - in since .4082 r/s),[removed],None,1593442279,1369,,NEGATIVE,0.9934806823730469
XSPA,Why People Need To Forget About $XSPA (lmbo I'm bullish btw; in since .4082 r/s),"TL;DR - $XSPA is a stock with a proven CEO, solid business plan, and three major airports away from this thing being $15-20. It WILL take off, but all unfounded doubt and speculation do is hurt it's potential. Sell if you want to sell, hold if you want to hold. It's that simple. Anything under $4.45 is good. Anything under $4.20 (which hopefully we won't see again) is gold.

I haven't been frequenting or following this sub as much as I was between March-May, but I wanted to offer some advice for those of you in $XSPA.

I remember the days when $XSPA was .24 cents. As a newbie I hopped in and the second it dropped to .22 cents a few days later, I hopped out - careful, cautious, reckless, and green. All of these applied to me. Well just my luck a week or two later was the first time it went 100% to .48. That was when XpressCheck was first announced and not long after Doug Satzman was announced as CEO, after which it went to .60. Here's the kicker though and where the title of my post comes in.

It was a solid MONTH between it going to .60 and the launch to 1+. I've seen a lot of people complaining and giving up hope asking, ""When are we going to the moon?"", ""What's taking so long?"", ""Should I sell?"", and my favorite, ""If I don't see anything by this \[insert day\], I'm selling."" I get it. But here's the thing.

I've studied this stocks patterns since I started trading. It's always been on my radar and tbh I hope the one that helps me hit it big. I've been here and made money off of $UAVS, $MVIS, and $MARK, all when they first had their big debuts.

If you WANT to be profitbale w/this stock, hyping it up constantly is not the move. I know the r/s and offering left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths, but at this point the best thing is to either sell or get in for the long haul and average down. I get we all have questions and want to know things, but the more speculation and doubt are in the air (which decreases its ability to consolidate), the less chance we have of flying when the real PR takes off.

My average was so low because SO SO SO many gave up hope and honestly hopped out. The amount of posts I've read of people who hopped out anywhere from 1-3 days before it went to $1 is unreal. But I watched and I wanted and I knew what I prices I wanted for the shares I wanted. I waited almost a month this time before I averaged up. Simply because I didn't want to ruin my average. I believe we have strong support at $4 (especially after today) and in the long term w/airports like Chicago, Miami, Dallas, LA, etc. we see 15-20 by end of August. But this will be a long hold. It always has been.",None,1593442230,1370,,NEGATIVE,0.9614596962928772

CLSK,WALMART AND CLSK CONFIRMED TODAY. AND MORE NEWS COMING,"Here it is, ladies and gentlemen. In the fucking flesh. Not only have we confirmed that the secret customer is Walmart, but through new series of conversation with Cleanspark, we are now being hinted at a new catalyst soon. Could this be a new potential big customer or contract??? There is likely to be news released THIS WEEK.

&amp;#x200B;

Exhibit A: HINTS TOWARDS WALMART (updated with extra emails)

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://imgur.com/a/ulq35an](https://imgur.com/a/ulq35an)\]([https://imgur.com/a/ulq35an](https://imgur.com/a/ulq35an))

&amp;#x200B;

Exhibit B: HINTS AT NEWS RELEASE SOON (a handful of your other fellow redditors have gone out on their own to contact CLSK and submitted emails like these to us)

&amp;#x200B;

\[[https://imgur.com/a/WAYHfXR](https://imgur.com/a/WAYHfXR)\]([https://imgur.com/a/WAYHfXR](https://imgur.com/a/WAYHfXR))

&amp;#x200B;

(names and contact information are blurred to protect all parties involved from harassment and their personal information.)

&amp;#x200B;

\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*How do we know it's Walmart???\*\* We have obtained ALL the pieces we need.

&amp;#x200B;

 1. ""One of the nation's largest retailers, with more than 6,300 stores in the U.S."" From Feb 4 Press Release. 

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart has 4,937 stores in the U.S. And they also own Sam's club and a major auto services chain with over 2,500 U.S. locations, and other subsidiaries as well).

&amp;#x200B;

 2. ""friends in Bentonville"" A huge hint from our email dialogue with investor relations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Walmart is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. Name me one other fucking company from fucking Bentonville that fits these descriptions. I’ll give you TWO BUCKS.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Walmart wants to be a leader in the clean energy movement and pledges to make a full scale shift to clean energy sources starting in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

WALMART STATEMENT: \*""Under these arrangements, Walmart agrees to buy renewable power from an energy provider over a long period of time – often 5, 10, 15 or more years. Long-term PPAs have unlocked enormous renewable potential, but have also required a new way of thinking.""\*

&amp;#x200B;

4. Read the newly added sections to the first email chain. NASDAQ restrictions and non-disclosure agreements have stifled Cleanspark's ability to publicize who these companies are in large-scale public news releases. But if you read into how NDA’s work, there are massive loopholes in how you can phrase things, especially in one-on-one contact. THEY HAVE WANTED US TO FIGURE IT OUT. And we URGE you to contact them yourself too if you want to hear the same results.

&amp;#x200B;

\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

• THIS IS WHY THEIR REVENUE HAS GROWN BY 1145% Year-over-year (Q2 2019 to Q2 2020).

&amp;#x200B;

How was this never priced in??? BUT OMG OP HOW??? IT’S OLD NEWS FROM FEB OP 😱😱😱

&amp;#x200B;

1. The SAME DAY it was announced (Feb 4) was one of the first days of the Covid stock market crash. The news was completely drowned out and left in the dust. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED ON THE CHART.

2. The secret customer was never publicly revealed to be Walmart due to non-disclosure agreements. But if you read into how NDA’s work, there are massive loopholes in how you can phrase things, especially in one-on-one contact.

&amp;#x200B;

—————————————————————————----------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* Oh and by the way, let’s forget about their government contracts, massive military contracts, and overseas expansion.

\* Lets also forget that they're adding huge scaling to their mVos and mPulse software to be implemented into university campuses for microgrid power outage back-up systems.

\* Let's also forget that insiders obtained a massive amount of shares on Thursday. It's not like they know something might be happening. Nah, of course not, they're only executives. Pfft.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That is all, good luck. See you in another galaxy soon.

IDEX,$IDEX Exit Strategy &amp; DD (General) Question,"Part #1)

- Hello hello! I am holding 2k shares @ an average of $1.53.

- I plan to sell at 9 AM Monday morning (I use Robinhood), it appears that unless Ideanomics drops a solid PR during Monday’s premarket they are looking at another day in the red. Might as well cut my losses and move on. How does this POA sound to fellow my fellow penny traders? 

- I was also wondering if anyone knows why someone bought 10m shares @ $1.46 before the bell on Friday? And how that might effect the stock come Monday?

—————————————————————————

Part #2) 

Additionally, during my first 5 weeks of trading I have learned a lot about picking stocks and DD. Currently I use a combination of Thinkorswim’s scanner and Twitter / reddit to find stocks of interest. I then do my own DD into the company and their financials before I invest. 

So far I have done a great job (other than this last impulse buy back into IDEX, live and learn!) However, I was wondering what you guys do? 

I’ve made my biggest plays on $IZEA, $BTE, $SOLO, $IDEX, $KTOV.

I’d like to hear other strategies for making picks! I started with $2,700 and I’m up to $5,200. I realize the stocks I’ve made money on are not typical as the market has been very bullish the past few weeks. 

My goal is to learn how to make more consistent picks, properly DD, and solidify a standard for myself when it comes to entry and exit strategies. 

I am eager to learn the right way and start making slow / steady gains... any and all advice is appreciated! Thanks in advance my friends 🙏🏼",Question,1593265409,1435,,NEGATIVE,0.9990938901901245

CJJD,Reason for CJJD AH nosedive,"China Jo-Jo Drugstores (CJJD) is unable to timely prepare and file its Annual Report on Form 10-K

June 26, 2020 4:27 PM 
China Jo-Jo Drugstores (NASDAQ: CJJD) disclosed:

China Jo-Jo Drugstores, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”) makes the following disclosure pursuant to the Order (the “Order”) issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 25, 2020 (Release No. 34-88465) providing conditional relief to public companies that are unable to timely comply with their filing obligations as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.


The Company’s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19. Thus the Company is unable to timely prepare and file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 (the “Annual Report”) that is due June 29, 2020 (the “Original Due Date”). Therefore the Company elected to rely on the conditional filing relief provided under the Order.

In light of the circumstances and uncertainty surrounding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business, employees, consultants and service providers of the Company, and considering the lack of time for the compilation, dissemination and review of the information required to be presented and the importance of markets and investors receiving materially accurate information in the Annual Report, the Company has determined that it will delay the filing of the Annual Report by up to 45 days after the Original Due Date, or until August 13, 2020.

Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company experienced a decline in the number of customer visits during the first three months of calendar 2020 due to the implementation of the lockdown policy in China. In addition, because some of our employees could not come to the workplace, we were short of staff which slowed down our logistic service and impacted our customer service at stores. However, as China is gradually controlling the spread of COVID-19, we believe these negative impacts are temporary. Currently we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of COVID-19 due to the developing circumstances and uncertainty surrounding this current pandemic, including the ultimate geographic spread of COVID-19, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and effectiveness of the actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. The management has been closely monitoring the impact caused by COVID-19 and we will continue to operate our business as steadily and safely as we can.",None,1593191907,1448,,NEGATIVE,0.9975996613502502

IDEX,Things to consider with the $IDEX Hindenburg allegations,"Personally, I am in for the long with $IDEX. I started off wanting to quick flip the stock, but after doing hard DD I concluded this was a great company to invest in for the long term. I truly believe in the company's vision and fully understand the demand for green energy having worked in the renewable energy sector myself in the past. (There is plenty of positive DD and PR about IDEX you can find online, so I won't touch on those).

If IDEX was truly a scam, it would be the most insane scam to secure a bunch of orders, get billion dollar institutions invested, do multiple global interviews, purchase multiple facilities, claim they are working with huge companies like Tesla - Nissan - etc to fulfill their orders, and the list goes on and on. Keep in mind that these companies care about their public image as well. If IDEX was truly a fraud, then these big time corps would come out and announce these claims as fraud because they certainly do not want their reputations slandered.

Hindenburg, as we all know, is notorious for shorting companies that are on a positive tear. They shorted companies like Tesla and Shopify in the past. Most recently they shorted $WINS on 6/16-6/17 causing the stock to go from $26 to $19. A week or so later the company rebounded to hit a high of $64. Take what they say with a grain of salt.

The allegations by Hindenburg have yet to be proven true. They claim that they had reporters go to the MEG center and take videos/photos. Claimed to have interviewed vendors there as well. Why are people not questioning these claims? First off, the video taken shows a banner from 2018 - and is a very short 15 second panorama. Why not post a video interviewing these ""vendors""? Isn't Qingdao closed off to the public at the moment? Why would there even be vendors there?

Hindenburg points out multiple times that IDEX has failed to respond to these allegations, however when the shoe is on the other foot, i.e. people asking Hindenburg to verify their claims - Hindenburg also remains silent. The videos/photos from Hindenburg have no time stamps or solid evidence that they are recent. To address the photoshopped photos, we are in a world wide pandemic. The MEG center has not been able to have their ribbon cutting ceremony yet which would explain the lack of photos. Also, it is common for photoshop to be used for marketing purposes. Photoshop is used all the time in real estate when homes are being marketed. Doesn't mean the home doesn't exist.

The community and the bears were silent when the stock was on fire going up, but as soon it starts dipping south they start calling it a scam. Go figure. Every negative thing is being magnified right now due to the scare. However, traders and investors need to take a step back and analyze why these allegations would come up in the first place. If a company is trash, you would just ignore it. Why spend countless hours trying to debunk a company that is ""destined"" for failure anyways? Why not just let it fall on it's own. Clearly there are ulterior motives.

This is just my opinion on the whole situation and if you don't agree then move on. I'm not looking to get in an argument over the internet with some random. I have my views, and others have theirs. However, many people were heavily invested in this company and lost lots of money due to CLAIMS (not proven) and scares. I advise everyone to do their own research before investing and believe what you hold. Amazon started in a jenky little room - if you were to look at a photo of Amazon back then you would've thought it was a scam also.

Q2 earnings report in August will do all the talking. Numbers don't lie. Not to mention, IDEX has a virtual conference on 6/30 with big time investors. If the fraud allegations are true, then I guess I done goofed. However, none of the companies and institutions that are connected with Ideanomics have come out to speak about any sort of false claims.

IDEX,"Alright, let’s go over today $IDEX","**I am not a professional, you also don’t have to agree with what I say.**

Alright kids, gather round, and let’s go over today, what happened, and why I think everything is still okay. Take a deep breath, for those of you who are still holding strong, and tell yourself it’ll be okay. Because it will be, and here’s why. 

I also want to remind those who may have forgotten, if you are still in this and haven’t sold, you haven’t lost money. Until you sell for a loss, you haven’t lost money, the stocks value has just gone down. And most likely only temporary. 

$IDEX was heavily, heavily attacked by shorts and those who want to see it not progress further than it already has. My first theory as to why it dipped as hard as it did and why it was attacked so heavily, besides the debunked Hindenburg, which I’ll talk about in a min. Sorry hold on, throwing a period in there, that run on sentence was a bitch. Anyways I was thinking and who loses the most out of Ideanomics becoming a near future giant in the green energy industry? Big oil, those fucks are so scared because fossil fuel has been their money makers. And if the world goes green, what the fuck do we need their oil for? Not nearly as much as we currently do. 

 [China is the 2nd](https://www.worldometers.info/oil/china-oil/)  second biggest oil consumer IN THE WORLD. Do you understand what that means if they are going green? [Take a look at this article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/1152575/as-china-greens-its-economy-these-people-businesses-and-nations-will-feel-the-pinch/amp/) that talks about back in 2018, they were looking to go green and cut out fossil fuels in the future. 2% of EV vehicles accounted for the vehicles in use. The fact that $IDEX has now taken the lead on their transformation to green energy, is fucking insane. In that article it also mention Russia and Saudi Arabia wanting to sell even more crude oil to China.

Alf mentioned in the interview today, how Mongolia is RICH in mineable materials. But it’s shut down do to micro toxins released into the air from the fossil fuels heavy duty mining vehicles. He also said how they have have proven to them, that their mining trucks release zero toxins, allowing mining to potentially resume. Do you know how much money is in that alone?? Fuck you and fuck me money. 

Alf also mentioned how they have their hands in multiple areas of business involving green energy, not just EV and HV. They literally just signed a deal where they are the number one investors in [providing energy for 5G](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ideanomics-meg-announces-the-official-launch-of-its-energy-services-unit-through-deal-with-new-infrastructure-service-provider-giant-zhongsen-tower-301083631.html) ... that’s reoccurring energy that doesn’t run out, and you know what? IT’S FUCKING CHEAP. Way cheaper than crude oil. [The cost to operate an EV compared](https://www.energysage.com/electric-vehicles/costs-and-benefits-evs/evs-vs-fossil-fuel-vehicles/) to a fossil fuel car is less than half. 

And don’t you think that all these companies who Ideanomics is partnered/invested/in business with would start speaking up if all this was a scam? Why would they want their names/reputation tarnished? They wouldn’t. And they haven’t said anything.

IDEX,$IDEX Ideanomics historic background and research - what they don't want you to see,"As is ascribed to Warren Buffett: ""Never invest in a business you cannot understand.""

Ideanomics, that darling of stonk-buyers, is currently taking a bit of a dump, as people question just what it does.

But true believers are holding strong, with ""diamond hands"" hoping against hope it will be the next Tesla, or Netflix, or cryptocoin play.

IDEX has had four different names since it was started, and shifted its business model just as many.

[On its website](https://ideanomics.com/about-us/founders-story/), the company now claims to have been founded in 2017 ""as a business transformation of an existing media company"" by Chinese billionaire Bruno Wu -- but it was actually founded in 2014 as ""YOU on Demand"" -- which later became ""WeCast Holdings"" -- by WWE pro wrestler Shane McMahon. 

That's right, it was started by the son of Vince McMahon, owner of the WWE, as a way to stream movies in China.

That could have made for a compelling story, if they actually made any money doing it.

But after [Bruno Wu's Sun Seven Stars got involved with an investment](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/837852/000106299315006226/exhibit99-1.htm), it became ""Seven Stars Cloud Holdings.""

And now Ideanomics.

Yeah, that's total nonsense jargon that sounds impressive, but doesn't actually do anything. 

Now they claim to sell EV cars, but no one can actually find the ""MEG center"" showroom they claim to use, or get confirmation that any of the supposed sales they've been promoting have ever happened.

LLIT,"$LLIT, an outstanding masl play! 🚀🚀","Guess what?! NEW DD THREAD! 

Stock: $LLIT- Lianluo Smart Ltd. 

$LLIT is a call by my friends @StanTradingMan and @theonlyrampart1 for good reason; it's a Covid-19 play with great value, which should sustain throughout the duration of- and potentially after- the Covid-19 pandemic. 
____________________________ 

Here's a quick outline of my $LLIT thread for reference: 

SUMMARY: 
-Introduction to LLIT 
-Covid-19 hot sector play 
-Mask usage by countries, esp. China and U.S.A.
-Lasting value post-Covid-19 
-Low float; another hot sector currently 
____________________________ 

Who is $LLIT? Lianluo Smart Ltd., located in Beijing, China. 

What does LLIT do? They distribute medical equipment, such as sleep apnea machines, VENTILATORS, and other instruments used in operating rooms, intensive care units, and emergency rooms across the world. Oh, and MASKS!

____________________________ 

Here is a link to purchase $LLIT masks

https://mall.lianluo.com/index.php/product-887.html 

I will admit, I'm not an expert in translating Mandarin to English. But, it appears the LLIT masks are durable and include a battery-operated filtration device designed for both breathability and protection. ____________________________ 

$LLIT is a very diverse company. In addition to masks and ventilators, they are also a 3% shareholder in $GHSI and play a role in the operation of (and may own part of but couldn't confirm) the popular e-commerce retailer Newegg.com! 
____________________________ 

Now that we know more about $LLIT and what they do, let's dig into why they're such a valuable play. 

The answer is easy: Covid-19 is currently the hottest sector of the penny stock market. LLIT is a MASK and VENTILATOR distributor from CHINA, the epicenter of the CV-19 pandemic. 
____________________________ 

While we can't determine the exact numbers, Statista.com states Asian countries tend to utilize masks more than any other region, with China being the second-highest global per-capita utilizer of masks at an 83% rate, vs only 50% in the US. Remember: $LLIT is in China!
 ____________________________ 

China has about 1.3 billion citizens. Per the above data, roughly 83% of Chinese citizens consistently wear masks. Yep, 1.08 BILLION people in CHINA ALONE are wearing masks on a daily basis! Located in Beijing, $LLIT has the most ideal market for mask distribution in the WORLD! 
____________________________ 

The fact that $LLIT is located in the capital city of the most populous country in the world, in a country where over 1 billion people consistently wear masks, means LLIT not only has the perfect market, but an appealing recipe for post-Covid value as well. 

Why is this? 
____________________________ 

Well, it's reasonable to assume masks will have a common household presence after CV-19 is gone. Because masks are so popular during CV-19 and must be replaced often, the demand for masks will likely not just go away once CV-19 is gone. Thus, $LLIT has potential post-CV-19 value. 
____________________________ 

Another attractive perf of $LLIT is its low float. With only 14.6 million shares on the market, LLIT is susceptible to rapid movement with a relatively low amount of volume. As of late, low-floaters have also been an extremely hot sector. Best of both worlds: TWO hot sectors! 
____________________________ 

$LLIT has a ton going for it currently. Not to mention it checks multiple boxes for most appealing penny stocks based on the current market. In pennies, you gotta play the hot plays, man! And as you can see, $LLIT is SCORCHING hot! What's not to love here?! $LLIT could run HUGE! 
____________________________ 

So, let's recap our $LLIT thread: 

-Distributes MASKS and VENTILATORS in CHINA 
-It is a CV-19 ""hot sector"" play 
-China has over 1 BILLION consistent mask-wearers 
-It has ample post-Covid potential 
-It's a low-floater, which is a very hot sector currently

Listen up tendie chasers, $IDEX is so far from being over its insane that people are selling right now. Today we experienced what a lot of people assumed was an offering, it fucking wasnt.IDEX just had three large orders filled, with others lining up behind them  Every time an order has gone through, We have seen a pretty spike in the price. A shelf offering for a company like IDEX is almost never a bad thing you retards, They are getting ready for something big. Alf Poor has done a great job at eluding to events that will positively effect the company and shareholders over the past month  They are fucking stoked and have done everything they can to leak hints without spilling the beans. If you dont believe me, check Alf’s twitter. Today, Alf name dropped Amazon and how they are looking to invest in clean energy and clean transportation. Trump also said trading with the Chinese is still a green light, IDEX is mainly located in China, not counting their actual headquarters in NY. Seriously just go through Alf’s Twitter, it’ll save me a lot of typing. They also have eluded heavily about their heavy(see what i did there lmao) duty trucks, but havent released any formal PR on the matter. Fuck i could keep going, but seriously just DD the rest  

One last thing; There was a sexy bull flag forming before the shelf offering... if you know how to somewhat read a chart, you can see another slightly smaller, but sexy bull flag forming AGAIN. Literally same day as the shelfing, that rarely fucking happens

-upcoming Cellulite drug PDUFA date on 7/6/2020
-last time drug application was approved in 2019, stock ran ~20%
-Company currently has 87.64% institutional holdings (aka, people who know what they are doing) 
- latest string of lawsuits about how ENDP “with other companies, caused the opioid crisis” have already prices themselves in, and they won’t have a verdict until October (meaning no sneak attack lawsuit verdicts to tank your stock) 
- average price target: 5.60 (says the always optimistic analysts) 


How to trade:
- price has flattened quite a bit over the last few days, wait until the first sign of upwards price action to signify the start of an up trend before you buy. 

- sell before announcement on the 6th, when negative price action starts, or be brave and hold through the announcement 

THIS IS MOST LIKELY NOT A 100% RUNNER, but still a good swing option.

CJJD,Why I bought 4K shares of CJJD and why you should get in too,"CJJD or “China Jo-Jo Drugstores Inc” is a pretty cool company.

Now what CJJD does is they’re the leading online AND offline retailer of pharmaceutical supplies in CHINA. And China is pretty big...to the tune of 1.4 BILLION people, whereas the United States sits around 400 million.

Why is this a big deal? Well CJJD’s earnings report is coming up, and this is the report that includes all the COVID related panic that the country has gone through over the past couple months while this pandemic has evolved. They beat estimates on their last report which shot the price to over $3, and with the sheer amount of covid sales they’re expected to blast past estimates this time. 

As of writing the stock sits at $1.83.....that’s a lot of room to move to $3+ folks and we know how huge these covid plays can be. With China starting to experience this “second wave” expect it to rocket to $3+ again come a week from now. 

Pretty common sense DD here but at the end of the day, common sense is really what it takes to make money.

BYFC,$BYFC Broadway Financial - Historic African-American Bank Saved From Take Over: Sugarman Sells Out.,"*Followup to my post from last week: [Historically black Broadway Federal Bank ($BYFC) in hostile takeover - #BlackLivesMatter](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/hbdgc4/historically_black_broadway_federal_bank_byfc_in/)*

#STEVEN SUGARMAN IS OUT!

[An SEC filing by Steven Sugarman posted late last night reveals](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-176081/):

&gt;""Between June 17, 2020 and June 19, 2020, Commerce Home Mortgage, LLC sold all 1,846,154 shares of voting common stock directly owned by it at a weighted-average share price of $2.59 per share.""

That's right-- he dumped all his shares into the market and missed out on the ride.  So yes, this does reveal those were his big ""sell walls"" that blocked upward momentum of the stock on Thursday and Friday, until it broke free. 

But he also did something extra douchey: he attached an ""FU"" letter to the Board, which insinuated that they weren't being black enough, and that they generally sucked-- just to be able to get it into the SEC record. That's some condescending bullshit right there, folks.

And then made this ridiculous claim,
&gt;In addition, we believe that the significant acquisitions of Broadway stock last week by parties acting, coordinating, and trading to further their common goals and agenda constitute a triggering event under the Shareholder Rights Plan implemented by the board in September 2019. We will be providing the Board additional correspondence relating to The Capital Corps’ rights under the Shareholder Rights Plan, including our rights related to the issuance of preferred shares in respect thereof, and look forward to discussing the same with Broadway.

Sugarman wants to get some poison pill ""preferred shares"" gifted to him by Broadway, even though he sold all his common stock-- because he wants to count Reddit/Twitter users as a ""coordinated effort.""

IDEX,$IDEX is doing what that chonk Jim Cramer said.....,"The market says they laugh at RH but have found the perfect way to use it.  Find a stock RH has a chub about like $IDEX.  Then hammer the hell out of it premarket with institutional money.  Then when market opens, a flood of RH autists ram it home to get on board and then the institutional money pulls profits out to begin the pull out before lunch.  The market using RH like a cattle farm.  

Rinsus and repeatus.  I'm not saying get out or don't do it, but at least it helps me explain the spikes and drops and allows me to better gauge a proper IN price if that stock is what I want to get on to.  Meanwhile losing my absolute shit watching this thing climb premarket without being in it.  As my previous post said, I got shaken out when I was up 200%, but they want me to try and buy back in at $2.50 - $2.80 because of the premarket enthusiasm.  But when the premarket money pulls its profit out before lunch, I'll set a buy somewhere in the $2.27 - $2.35 and if it doesn't return, then I go look for next target.  The illusion is that the climb simply holds or continues.  It's like syphoning gas, premarket gets the flow going, RH along with some massaging by the firms, holds the flow or increases, then the firms take the can away and put an empty one in its place to start filling more.",None,1592816997,1798,,NEGATIVE,0.9988662004470825

SOLO,Updated DD on SOLO Electra Meccanica,"SOLO gets a lot of flack for looking ugly, and I admit on first glance I was confused at what I was looking at. But this might be a nice little goldmine for anyone that has patience! It also makes nice smaller reliable gains rather than a lot of the 50-100% gainers we have been seeing lately then they dump back to half the price again.

I am in 8k shares of SOLO at 1.80 for transparency but here are my recent thoughts on SOLO and why I think this is one of the better investments/swing trades to consider over the weekend.

First of all, Electra Meccanica just released some PR that they are expanding their retail footprint for the flagship SOLO in Oregon and Arizona. This is exciting news for a few reasons.

* This is prime territory for their EV considering harsh winter weather could make their product unmarketable in certain areas of the US. This starts them off strong, with them having plans to expand throughout the country over the next 18 months, 2 years globally.
* Oregon provides a cool $2,500 rebate as an incentive for EV's. (California $750)
* Arizona is ""rumored"" to be the location of their new US production plant, and a new retail awareness through Arizona creates speculation as to whether this could be one of their locations for an EV factory (Nikola, Tesla, and others also have EV factories located in Arizona coincidentally.)

Other recent news suggests that Electra Meccanica is essentially on their final stages of the SOLO premiere. They are also willing to be patient to execute their plans as precisely as possible, and this means the actual US launch of the SOLO could lean towards August/early September. (It could be earlier, it could be later)

Why do I suggest buying in now? After watching SOLO for 2 weeks, I have analyzed the movement and price strength and here are the results:

* Highest price: $2.30 in AH, $2.20 in Market hours.
* Lowest price: $1.59 in AH, 1.60-1.80 all time lows.
* Median price range $1.90-$2.00 AH, $1.91-2.03 Market hours.

So essentially, if played right there is an almost $0.70 difference in just about a weeks worth of price movement based on only 1 PR release ([https://investors.electrameccanica.com/press-releases/detail/109/electrameccanica-responds-to-economic-re-opening-with](https://investors.electrameccanica.com/press-releases/detail/109/electrameccanica-responds-to-economic-re-opening-with)) and regular price movement based on upcoming catalysts.

Upcoming catalysts:

* Introduction of new US factory
* Official news on the launch of the SOLO (set for release in Los Angeles late 2020)
* Speculation on the SOLO gen 2, the Tofino, or the e-Roadster
* Confirmation of number of Pre-Order sales (rumored to be around 20,000)
* Any other legitimate PR

Fundamentally, SOLO seems like one of the safest bets you can make in today's recent volatile market. The look does not please everyone... Some have blatantly said they despise it. But that is also what makes it so special, set up to either succeed majorly in todays ""CO-VID and Clean Energy"" climate, or majorly fail. But my gut tells me that this company believes in their product like no tomorrow, and will do everything they can to see all their plans come to fruition.

The CEO stated in an interview, they need focus on the launch of the SOLO, and once that is complete they can focus on other projects like the Tofino more closely. 2020 is the year of the SOLO.

As of tonight, SOLO sits right below my buy in price and I believe that is an good price for a potential buy in. A dip to 1.70 is possible, but SOLO jumps nicely on good volume and has a relatively low float compared to some stocks. So, if SOLO does break out again it should move relatively fast and break $2.00 no sweat, potentially more. No FOMO here, just a solid company, product, and future outlook. You don't have to like the look yourself, however I can see this becoming a cool niche EV that people could find attractive thanks to rebates and a unique sporty look.",Research,1592607944,1846,,POSITIVE,0.6816932559013367

BYFC,Historically black Broadway Federal Bank ($BYFC) in hostile takeover - #BlackLivesMatter,"On a day when NY's historically black-centric Carver Bancorp ($CARV) soared to as high as $21 (+775%) in the morning and closed +248%, one must ask why the similar, Broadway Financial Corp ($BFYC) in LA, which also serves the African-American community hadn't likewise seen such gains (yet).

On Tuesday, BFYC was as low as $1.23-- yesterday it was as high as $2.32, before settling at $1.69 (+18%) at close. At the end of AH trading, it suddenly shot up to $3 -- yet in pre-market trading, it was pushed back down to $2, before retail traders would even have the ability to get into it. 

Why is it being kept down? Let's follow the breadcrumbs back to one person, with a financial interest in keeping BFYC depressed. 

**BACKGROUND**

Broadway Federal Bank was founded in 1946 by early black civil-rights leaders, including businessman and dentist [H. Claude Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Claude_Hudson) and famed architect [Paul R. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Williams), specifically to offer banking services to the underserved minorities in LA. 

It's a federally chartered S&amp;L bank, but shockingly, the last traditionally African-American community bank headquartered on the West coast.

Since going public in 1995, of course, it is no longer considered ""black-owned"" since anyone can buy shares -- but its [explicit mission](https://www.broadwayfederalbank.com/history) is ""to serve the real estate, financial and business needs of customers in underserved urban communities.""

The current CEO is [Wayne-Kent Bradshaw](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi-bradshaw-20180727-story.html), who took over in 2009. Since then, he has steadily grown the balance sheet.

Financials:
* 3Q 2019, the assets were $414.6M;
* by 4Q 2019 they were $442M; 
* and by 1Q20 hit $506M. 

At the same time, deposits have increased: from $286M last year to $333M last quarter.

Bradshaw has done this by [refocusing attention on expanding the portfolio of loans](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/how-the-wests-only-black-bank-has-evolved/the-evolution-of-the-wests-only-black-bank) for ""Class C"" multifamily units -- lower-cost housing in the range of $500M to $2.5M, which tends to be below what bigger banks will touch. According to Bradshaw, however, “Our average borrower probably has a net worth of $7 million.”

**Barbarians at the Gates**

All this unfortunately hasn't been reflected in the value of the stock price-- which has under 20M shares outstanding. So at its low point of the year, $1.04, it had a market cap of barely $20M. That would be a cheap price to pay for a company that holds half a billion dollars in assets and over $300M in deposits.

This hasn't escaped the notice of outside parties, those who would try to buy out the bank entirely, taking it private, to get a taste of those sweet, sweet assets.

In answer to that threat, in September 2019, the Board of Directors enacted a ""[Shareholder's Rights Plan](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190911005251/en/Broadway-Financial-Corporation-Announces-Adoption-Stockholder-Rights)"" (AKA ""poison pill"") which would give additional voting rights to existing shareholders if anyone attempted to acquire over 10% of the company -- as a way to prevent such a takeover.

But one such person is trying: Steven Sugarman, former CEO of Banc Of California-- who [resigned in 2017 under dubious circumstances](https://www.ocregister.com/2017/01/24/banc-of-california-ceo-resigns-following-sec-probe/), which included a criminal investigation. 

Just after losing his CEO gig, Sugarman founded ""The Capital Corps"" as his own personal financial fiefdom, and then acquired lender Commerce Home Mortgage as a subsidiary.

(It might also be worth mentioning that Sugarman is-- shall we say-- *not* black, and has no personal interest or connection to the African-American community.)

In February, through his companies, [Sugarman acquired a ton of BYFC](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-030009/) -- 9.66% or 1.8M shares -- just under the poison pill threshold. **This made him the largest single shareholder in the company.**

He did so through Commerce Home Mortgage, and immediately sent a letter to the Board of Broadway Federal, saying that they wanted to buy the company, demanding a meeting and to drop the whole poison pill thing.

CEO Bradshaw wrote back a [neutrally worded letter](https://www.broadwayfederalbank.com/Media/BroadwayFed/pdf/Financial%20Highlights/Broadway%20Financial%20Corporation_8-K%20Feb.%2012,%202020%20[As-filed].pdf) to the effect of ""we'll get back to you on that.""

**OH NO YOU DIDN'T**

Sugarman didn't like the sound of that -- and had his underlings [draft a stern reply with threats of litigation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000119312520041863/d574750dex991.htm) which further went into how much Broadway sucks, and how Broadway's board should listen to them and do everything they said... or else.

On April 13, the Capital Corps tried to [float an unsolicited offer to buy out the bank](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001171/000119312520106014/d882933dex991.htm)... for $1.75 or $48M, which they called a ""premium of approximately 33% to the 30-Day average closing price of the Company’s common stock.""

Naturally, the [Board rejected this tender](https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-capital-corps-llc-says-on-may-8-de/brief-capital-corps-llc-says-on-may-8-delivered-letter-to-broadway-financials-board-idUSFWN2CQ19E), which represented less than a tenth of the assets held by the bank. 

But Sugarman wasn't done. He decided he was going to run his own candidates for the board, and have a proxy fight, thus try to take over the company from within.

Only *OPPS!* apparently [Commerce Home Mortgage wasn't a shareholder on record as of May 1](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200615005803/en/Broadway-Financial-Corporation-Files-Supplement-Proxy-Statement), and thus, Commerce ""is not eligible under Broadway’s bylaws to nominate a candidate for election to Broadway’s board of directors.""

So that's where things stand right now -- and the annual shareholders' meeting is just one week away.

**Manipulation**

Remember that Sugarman had control of over 1.8M shares. It would be in his company's interest to continue to depress BYFC's stock price to at or below its tendered amount -- otherwise, they may not be able to buy it outright.

Certainly, they could no longer claim to be giving it a ""fair valuation"" if the stock was now twice or more what it had been when they floated their offer just a few months ago.

Thus, it would be trivial for them to sell small amounts into the market, keeping the price artificially low.

However, this may not last much longer: if the price keeps going up (through pumping or retail interest), Sugarman will have no recourse but to give up his takeover attempts, and sell his holdings (and take the profits!)

IDEX,To my IDEX people,"Just wanted to remind everyone who might feel like they missed out on IDEX and are waiting to buy tomorrow morning: remember that IDEX is a company with pretty questionable history and while they look promising with their EV deals, more often than not penny stocks are just pumped and dumped--they rarely become billion-dollar companies.

And to people who are certain that IDEX will become a billion-dollar company or will 10x in value: just remember that top trading firms have the smartest ivy-league graduates working with the most sophisticated tools to predict stock prices. If anyone could predict the next GNUS, it would be them. But rarely do they predict the next billion-dollar penny stock. In fact, even a 30% gain on their portfolio would put them way ahead of any other firm, leave alone 100% or 2300% gain.

Even if you did end up making money on GNUS by betting it all and make money on IDEX in a similar way, in the long run, such a strategy is guaranteed to lose money. Otherwise, these hedge funds would be making 100% profit a year, not struggling to barely beat the market &amp; be happy when they make 15% profit.

With that in mind, feel free to invest in IDEX if you believe it will go to the moon.",Discussion,1592428748,1981,,NEGATIVE,0.9983924031257629

BYFC,$BYFC - Broadway Federal Bank - deep dive into dastardly drama,"On a day when NY's Carver Bancorp ($CARV) soared to as high as $21 (+775%) in the morning and closed +248%, one must ask why the similar, Broadway Financial Corp ($BFYC) in LA, which also serves the African-American community hasn't likewise seen such gains (yet).

Yesterday, BFYC was as low as $1.23-- today it was up to as high as $2.32, before settling at $1.69 (+18%) at close. (NOTE: while writing this, the stock shot up at close of AH)

Some background: Broadway Federal Bank was founded in 1946 by early black civil-rights leaders, including businessman and dentist [H. Claude Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Claude_Hudson) and famed architect [Paul R. Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Williams), specifically to offer banking services to the underserved minorities in LA. 

It's a federally chartered S&amp;L bank, but shockingly, the last traditionally African-American community bank headquartered on the West coast.

Since going public in 1995, of course, it is no longer considered ""black-owned"" since anyone can buy shares -- but its [explicit mission](https://www.broadwayfederalbank.com/history) is ""to serve the real estate, financial and business needs of customers in underserved urban communities.""

The current CEO is [Wayne-Kent Bradshaw](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-himi-bradshaw-20180727-story.html), who took over in 2009. Since then, he has steadily [grown the balance sheet](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/byfc/financials/balance-sheet/quarter).

In the 3Q 2019, the assets were $414.6M;
by 4Q 2019 they were $442M; 
and by 1Q20 hit $506M. 

At the same time, deposits have increased: from $286M last year to $333M last quarter.

Bradshaw has done this by [refocusing attention on expanding the portfolio of loans](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/how-the-wests-only-black-bank-has-evolved/the-evolution-of-the-wests-only-black-bank) for ""Class C"" multifamily units -- lower-cost housing in the range of $500M to $2.5M, which tends to be below what bigger banks will touch.

I called out the HEXO run at around 0.7, but I have refined my approach towards an algo that takes a variety of factors such as technicals and sentiment into account. My goal is to consistently find pennies that have at least a 10-20% upside from its current levels within the span of 1-3 weeks (1 month at the latest). I'm not going to reveal the variables behind the algo, but so far, it has alerted me on stocks such as EVOK, SNSS, AMPE, ACOR, CFMS, VBIV and others before their big pumps. The goal here isnt to get one stock that is gonna be a home run, but consistently find stocks where you can generate at least 10-20% or more with your entry. While it will most likely alert me on things that may not pan out, the goal is to find high probability setups that will generate profits. I am currently starting up a stocktwits account where the algo will automatically post its findings in real time, but I was wondering if people also want me to separately post here once or twice a week with the pennies that the algo finds. It's doing scans 24/7 so once in a while I would have to just make a post with the ticker list on here, if you guys want. Basically, do you guys check reddit more or stocktwits?

One of my indicators to buy was a news catalyst about partnering with GNC and Vitamin Shoppe. That all led to a gradual increase in volume and the sudden spike later on. 

Moving on, this stock just had a few spikes in volume today, including a purchase of 1 million shares. They did have a nother tweet today about their Q2 revenues being ""beyond expectations"". I know some have talked about it being a possible shell corp, but the building its in has a Starbucks right there, which would make me think they're trying to slide their Secret Java line in. 

Anyway, just thought I'd let yall know. I'm going to monitor this potential beast for the next few days and see how that volume gets. But please, do your own DD before investing. Thank you!

NBRV,DD for NBRV,"NBRV STOCK

UP 12% as of today! 

NBRV stock was followed up on once again. Nabriva’s XENLETA (lefamulin) was in focus. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of the therapy to treat community-acquired pneumonia. Considering coronavirus has been compared to other upper respiratory diseases, could this be something to also keep in mind for additional applications? Good question, but what’s more is that Nabriva has something else that may be a target of interest this week.

In December 2019, Nabriva resubmitted an NDA for CONTEPO, its urinary tract infection drug. The FDA accepted its application and scheduled the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date for June 19, 2020. So that date may be one to keep in mind. However, in connection with its review of the NDA for CONTEPO, the FDA said it needed to inspect the facilities of third-party manufacturers in Europe.

The Average price target for NBRV is $3.92! (Wall Street Journal) 

They also have a high expected of 7$!!

What to look for?!
June 19, they will be getting an FDA approval that has been held up due to Covid. They were only stalled because of covid, yet the approval is going past on the 19th!! 

Today, they are up 12% currently, expected to keep climbing through out the week. :)",Research,1592222383,2098,,NEGATIVE,0.9651088118553162

GNUS,Twas the night before GNUS app launch...,"'Twas the night before GNUS Launch, when all through the house

Not a ticker was stirring, not even a mouse;

The stocks were all bought by traders with care,

In hopes that a Moon launch soon would be there;

The traders were nestled all snug in their beds;

While visions of GNUS GLORY danced in their heads;

And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in an anxious hell,

Had just settled our brains to wait for the opening bell,

When out internet there arose such a clatter,

I sprang to my laptop to see what the hell was the matter.

To google, to the news, I searched like a flash,

Another great update to help up our cash.

CBS, Netflix and Disney all in on the show,

Gave a luster of midday to objects below,

When what to my wondering eyes did appear,

But posts about Arnold buying up stocks around here,

With a little Due Diligence,  so lively and quick,

I knew in a moment this wasn't a trick,

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

""Now, Disney! now, Amazon! now CBS and listen!

On, Hulu! on, Vudu! on, Pluto television!

To the top of the stock market! to the top of the wall!

Up and away! Up and away! Nothing can cause us to fall!""

As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, they mount to the sky;

So up to the Moon our share values flew

We will all buy a sleigh full of toys, and some garbage stocks too—

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof

The stamping and pawing of each bullish hoof.

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the chimney, Stan Lee came, out with a bound.

He was dressed for success, from his head to his foot,

And his clothes were  untarnished by the ashes and soot;

A bundle of cash he had flung on his back,

His final works had brought GNUS back.",Shitpost,1592180793,2111,,NEGATIVE,0.9989909529685974

XSPA,My 2 cents on XSPA,"My 2 cents on XSPA

So everyone holding XSPA seems to be shitting their pants. Just want to give my opinion on it. Keep in mind I don’t know shit and this is speculation on my half. Everyone was guessing that the r/s from yesterday was to take XSPA from a penny stock and introduce it to the big boys (aka hedge funds). However, there could be another perspective we’re not looking at. Perhaps XSPA could have foreseen an impending tumble in the Stock market. Today is a blood bath for the bears in the DOW in general. Maybe XSPA board did the r/s to keep the stock on the NASQAD as it would have fallen under $1 today and would have been delisted to OTC on Monday. I think XSPA is still in talks with other airports but maybe this “2nd wave of corona” news is scaring airports and they are now hasty to re-open flights back up. This is probably causing a delay in XSPA securing contracts. 
Look at some of the facts. At 7am EST today there was 263K volume movement in the 30min time frame. Big volume. Price for asking went all the way up to $8.49 in that time. This could have been when the fund managers were getting in. However, then the DOW took a -600 point shit when the market opened. This probably scared off the big boys and they likely pulled immediately out. The rest of the day the DOW, NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 all went to bear slide city. EVERYTHING IS DOWN PEOPLE. Not just XSPA. Do your DD and realize that the airports will one day have to reopen. And now with this 2nd wave bs flying around, they will have to invest into testing. Hold strong brothers. The gains will take your account to levels you never imagined. It will take time. It will take heart and courage. It will take hand strength training. But I honestly believe this will be a rocket like we haven’t seen before. Off to the tendie galaxy!

Disclaimer: doubled down on my XSPA. Fuck yeah. Cheap shares. 

TL;DR : Maybe the r/s from yesterday was an Insurance move on their half to keep from getting delisted today.",Discussion,1591892392,2177,,NEGATIVE,0.998887836933136

My preorder is #146xx and they confirmed to me that yes, they have almost 15k preorders. A rough dirty math estimate places them at ~$280,000,000 in preorders (obviously before any up sells in price and also debits for overhead). They are planning a massive NYC launch as well (virus stopped this from happening sooner) but the vehicles are currently on Generation 3 of design (not exact but this new version with the refined interior and LED lights is currently green lit for production, just needing final tooling to “flip the switch” (as investor relations told me).

I’ll be getting my SOLO in NYC as soon as possible to start a channel on life with a single seat electric vehicle, as I personally always needed transport like this and I can’t believe on my birthday, they called me back to discuss the vehicle further.

This company is as real as it gets and to think GNUS on kids cartoons is above an actual product that made $200m easy in sales (once again, shipping is the only factor keeping them held up considering final tooling is not such a problem for their most die hard fan base in LA)...

I think XSPA is trying to get the attention of these larger investors by doing a 3:1 reverse split which will put the stock JUST outside of penny land.

&amp;#x200B;

Most stocks do a at least a 5:1 split and many do splits of 10+:1 to make that $1 compliance farther away. Look at $ACB for example, they did a 12:1 split. Think about why XSPA chose 3:1, the were probably going to meet compliance on their own. 3:1 gets them just enough to get over the $5 hump. They did this to get out of penny land to get the big money in here. Once they are able to invest in this i think it will take off fast.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i've read a lot of DD's on this ticker recently, but found a good one one on another reddit. 

Source 1: TipRanks :

&gt;Actinium Pharmaceuticals develops ARCs, or Antibody Radiation-Conjugates, capable of combining the targeting ability of antibodies with radiation’s cell killing ability. Given that the company recently strengthened its balance sheet, the analyst community sees its $0.21 share price as reflecting the ideal entry point.  
&gt;  
&gt;ATNM has raised $31.6 million through equity financing in April. Maxim analyst Jason McCarthy believes that this is important because it frees the company up to focus on the Phase 3 Sierra trial, which is a single pivotal trial evaluating Iomab-B as a treatment for patients age 55 and up with [r/r](https://www.reddit.com/r/r/) AML. McCarthy commented, “While it’s been a bumpy road on multiple fronts for Actinium that has pushed the shares to near its 52-week low, management has continued to execute, positioning the company for the home stretch to get to pivotal Phase 3 data.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking at the data that has been released so far, McCarthy stated, “The 50% enrollment BMT numbers tell us the trial has an inherent imbalance, not by the design, but by the fact that sadly these patients are so sick that the chemo arm mostly won’t make it to BMT. This is what was observed with only 7/38 making it vs. 31/31 in the Iomab arm.” The fact that most patients had been heavily pretreated and had relapsed/refractory disease made this result unsurprising.  
&gt;  
&gt;It should be noted that there are 80 days left to reach the six-month time for the durable complete remission (dCR) endpoint, and the Iomab arm currently has six times more patients than the chemo arm. “Assuming this trend continues to the 100 patient mark (ad hoc data analysis in 2Q20 that would be reported in 4Q20) or the top-line data for all N=150 in 2021, the probability of reaching the primary endpoint with statistical significance should favor Iomab,” McCarthy said.  
&gt;  
&gt;This combined with a cash runway that should extend into 2021 and through both the SIERRA Phase 3 top-line data readout and potential BLA filing, McCarthy concluded, “As such, we see an attractive option for investors, in what is a tough COVID environment, to build positions in ATNM and await the interim data later this year.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Bearing this in mind, McCarthy reiterated a Buy rating and $1.50 price target. The five-star analyst’s target implies shares could soar 603% in the next year. (To watch McCarthy’s track record, click here[here](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/jason-mccarthy))  
&gt;  
&gt;Like McCarthy, other analysts also take a bullish approach. ATNM’s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 3 Buys and zero Holds or Sells. Given the $2.75 average price target, shares could skyrocket 1,172% in the coming twelve months. (See Actinium stock analysis on TipRanks)

This could be a trillion dollar market by 2030. The renewable energy transition is well underway and carbon capture is an interesting niche that stands to do very well (I have a lot of positions in solar stocks, but that’s a different conversation).

I have mixed feelings about Motley Fool but I stumbled upon this write up after doing more research on the ccus market.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/07/up-over-1000-in-6-months-fuelcell-energy-stock-bus.aspx

I haven’t looked into the company’s financials any more than this article. Here’s what I learned: 

-June 2019, signed deal with Drax Power in UK for its carbon capture

-Nov 2019, entered into a $60m 2 year deal with ExxonMobil

-Fuel cell generation backlog has doubled in value to $1.2b since 2018, w/ a total backlog of $2b (9 projects, totaling 80 MW. For reference, a MW is enough energy to power ~650 homes). 

-Also Nov 2019, got eight year $200m loan to work on those projects in the backlog.

Don’t substitute this for your own research, but I’m bullish on renewable energy across the board, and with $FCEL’s strike price of $2.70 it seems like a great time to get in. I wouldn’t expect money bags to roll in anytime soon, but keep it on your radar.

Basically, it's to reassure shareholders that they are waiting on FDA approval. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200420005232/en/NovaBay-Pharmaceuticals-Signs-Agreement-Distribute-COVID-19-Antibody They promised to update end of May, but it's already Jume 4th and nothing has been published. 

They're selling covid masks, so the EPS should be positive. However, earnings are in August.

TL; DR- $NBY is primed for take off, but news come slowly. Don't buy in if you don't trust this ticker. But at .82 to .83, it's low enough to enter and wait for it to rise. It is being shorted at this moment, within a week it went from .87 to .82. Just an FYI.

────────

Tmbr. 

This is a fun ticker. Merger news, it went from .30c to .70. Rs news came. Rs happened. From 7.40 down to 2.60

It's bottomed out. Only go up from now. Since this isn't a typical ""penny"" stock... I'll leave it to you to Google TMBR. It's sitting at a cool 2.80 to 2.90, and it should readjust to 4.00 within next week.

News about the merger hasn't really been capitalized on bc it was overshadowed by the RS.

XSPA,BUY XSPA STONKS ONLY GO UP,"XpresSpa Group (Formally Known as FORM Holdings) is the worlds largest airport spa company with services specifically tailored to the busy consumer. XpresSpa has over 750 employees (Or it did prior to COVID) and is located in 51 locations in 25 airports globally. 

&amp;#x200B;

XSPA took a big hit from COVID. Being forced to close all locations due to being non-essential and therefore loosing all revenue. From my understanding this is what caused the ticker to drop from $1.20 to $0.13. 

&amp;#x200B;

April 13th, 2020. $0.35. XpresSpa Group hires Dr. Lewis Lipsey as first chief medical director for its XpresTest Subsidiary. "" We are thrilled to be adding Doctor Lipsey to our executive management team. He has over 30 years of experience as a medical doctor and is uniquely qualified to oversee Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Screening and Testing at U.S. Airports. He will be a valued asset and advisor to the Company during these unprecedented times."" - Doug Satzman, XpresSpa Group CEO. Here is where I start getting pretty bullish on this stock. Will COVID still be a global issue by the time they are up and operating COVID tests in every airport? (Personally yes) but who knows. But that is not why I am investing. This company is willing to make huge swings to what they do to meet the public need as well as being socially responsible. 

May 22nd, 2020. $0.88. (60% jump from day prior) XpresSpa signs Contract with JFK International Air Terminal for COVID-19 Screening and Testing Location. This site will hold nine seperate testing rooms with a capacity to administer over 500 tests per day. THIS NUMBER IS VERY LOW but i guess they are only planning on testing pilots and staff at this time. Future goal to test passengers? There will be more of contracts. As many as 25 total. 

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XSPA/xpresspa/financial-statements](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/XSPA/xpresspa/financial-statements) Here is a link to their financials. I don't really know what I am looking at (some advice would be much appreciated) but from what I can tell these guys have no money and are in debt.

WORK,HOW DAY TRADES WORK,"Since I've been seeing a lot of people asking day trade questions here lately I thought I'd write up a little breakdown on the bare basics. I'm not an expert. If anyone who knows more about this than me (probably a lot of you) see something wrong or misleading, let me know and I'll change it.

1) DAY TRADE LIMITS

If you use 1 of your 3 day trades, it won't clear for 5 TRADING DAYS. This means if I use a day trade on Wednesday, that day trade won't be available to me again until Wednesday of the next week: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday. 5 trading days.

This only applies to those who have less than 25k in their instant or gold account portfolios.

2) DAY TRADES ONLY COUNT IF YOU BUY *THEN* SELL A STOCK ON THE SAME DAY.

If you have 500 shares of $SHIT and sell some or all of those shares, you can still buy another 500 shares on the same day without using a day trade. HOWEVER, if you have 500 shares from yesterday, sell 300, buy another 200, and then try to sell any of them (even just 1 share) THAT will use a day trade because you're selling a share of a stock you bought that day.

Basically, you can sell and then buy, but you can't buy and then sell without using a day trade.

3) STOP LOSSES/TRAILING STOPS/LIMIT SELLS COUNT!

Let's say you buy 100 shares of $SHIT and immediately set a trailing stop loss on some or all of those shares. Setting the trailing stop loss won't count as a day trade UNLESS IT EXECUTES. If it executes on the same day, that's a day trade. If it executes the next trading day or later, it's not. Be cautious; if you've already used all 3 day trades and you set up a stop loss on a stock you bought and it executes the same day you bought the stock, it'll push you over your 3 day trade limit.

4) IF YOU'RE NEW/UNCERTAIN, KEEP PATTERN DAY TRADE PROTECTION ON

If you don't know what would constitute a day trade, don't shut pattern day trade protection off. A little popup will appear every time you try to execute something that would be considered a day trade to warn you that's what you're doing (if you've already used all of your day trades). This popup doesn't happen unless all of your day trades are used, but it'll at least keep you in compliance so you can avoid the 90 day penalty for going over.",Discussion,1591195352,2856,,NEGATIVE,0.9995476603507996

Question: how much cash do you have?
Answer: A sufficient amount.

Question: how many machines have you installed?  What's in the pipeline?

PRCP is currently trading for ~2.80. They were slowly building up from Mid 2016-Early 2020 then started to loose value quick, (from trading in the $6 range to trading in the the $5 range) and COVID made it drop significantly more (low 2.34). It's since only partially/half-way recovered. I'll paste a description of what the company does at the bottom, but I don't really understand why their business would have been heavily effected by COVID.

The only recent news I can find regarding them is positive. I'll paste a link to a Yahoo Finance article directly below, from late April. It sounds like they expanded due to demand for one of their products.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perceptron-announces-accusite-order-expansion-200510470.html

There's barely any traction on the Stockwits forum, but what there is sounds pretty positive.

EAST,BIOC - CONFERENCE TODAY AT 12 PM EAST,"BIOCEPT (BIOC) has beaten consensus estimates ($0.10) during Q1 2020 with a reported EPS of $0.20. In the last 6 quarters BIOC revenue has increased quarter over quarter from $0.76M to $1.78M. The company reported double-digit revenue during the first quarter of Q1 2020 despite the headwinds from COVID-19 pandemic. It recently released a new Target Selector molecular assay research-use-only kit for clients to use in their own laboratories. This kit will help detect solid tumors cancers, including lung cancer and melanoma.

&amp;#x200B;

The company's total assets ($29M) is greater than its total liabilities($7M).

&amp;#x200B;

BIOCEPT has a conference today at 12PM EAST and an upcoming earnings report in June.

&amp;#x200B;

The benefit of the conference is the exposure to new investors. This stock has a lot of upside potential and it can soar from an influx of new capital. The demand for BIOC's Target Selector can increase revenue up to 1.5X. 

&amp;#x200B;

Funds such as Vanguard Group, Barclays, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, and Black Rock own stakes in the company.

TRPX,A play in $TRPX?,"TL;DR below.

* **The global picture**

At 19^(th) April 2020, [a study](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0315/v1) has been published about the potential use of medicinal cannabis to combat COVID-19. It wasn't a surprise that this caught the media's eyes and attention; cannabis farms and biotechnology went a bit in the green at the time.  (This could be causation instead of correlation, judge it yourself).

The study could be biased since it's published by a [cannabis-focused biotech company](https://inplantabiotechnology.com/) on the website Preprints. Researchers can publish their paper on [Preprints](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-the-tide-is-coming-for-medicinal-cannabis/a-53371342) without a previous rigorous peer review. 

It doesn't really matter whether this published report is reliable or not. I see more and more CBD/cannabis-oriented bio companies (i.e. [Avicanna Inc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVCN.TO?p=AVCN.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), [Therapix biosciences](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRPX?p=TRPX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch), and [Curaleaf](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CURLF?p=CURLF&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch))  rising from the bottom nowadays. 

We have to take advantage of the current situation right of the *bat* (pun intended)! Don't chase the pump, but jump in beforehand. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **What about Therapix Biosciences Ltd. $TRPX?**

Therapix Biosciences Ltd., a specialty clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, develops drugs based on cannabinoid molecules. 

They have four pipeline drugs. All in development and one of them in phase 2B. Never been profitable and probably won't be in the near term.

But what could drive this stock upwards? 

1. Well, the possible play of a pump and dump by rumors of a COVID-19 vaccine. Or better, they'll announce a trial to study or develop a possible COVID-19 cure with the help of cannabis components. 
2. Good press releases about their current pipeline.
3. A [new CEO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/therapix-biosciences-announces-appointment-ceo-203000647.html) with a degree in economy and finance - 15 years of experience in the industry. This could make the CEO a bit sketchy, since he may be here for the money only. Just look for possible inside buying and selling of him to keep track of the company; he may want to temporarily push the stock higher for personal needs.
4. News about the [reverse merger](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/therapix-pursues-reverse-merger-cbd-174530045.html) that was talked about 3-6 months ago. (The news about this is almost certain to happen). 

&amp;#x200B;

* **So what's our plan, Captain?**

As of this moment, the stock suddenly skyrocketed 13.3% in the last 15 minutes. I searched for any indicators, but couldn't find any. That's why I decided to jump off at $0.505 with 10.000 shares with an entree of $0.42. I believe this was caused by FOMO and the stock will fall tomorrow. 

I suspect that it will reach $0.45 this week, if not tomorrow. This stock has proven time by time that it can't hold for long after a peak; the previous press releases were not astonishing enough to support. But the support is raising slowing as time passes by. It went from $0.35 to $0.40 to $0.45(?). 

Play the peaks, guys. Buy when there's no hype, sell when there's sudden hype but no news, hold when there's hype and news. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **TL;DR:**

Play the current hype 'COVID-19 cured by cannabis? Let's smoke with Elon Musk on Twitter'. $TRPX has many catalysts to become booming and make you money: 

1. Possible announcement of COVID-19 vaccine trial
   1. Quick pump and dump
2. Press releases about the current pipeline
3. New CEO focused on finance and economy
4. Possible news about the ongoing reverse merger

The company just spiked by no news. It will be down since it has nothing to back it up (although it seems like to hold nicely after hours). Good entree is between $0.40-$0.50. I try to enter at $0.45.",Research,1590511519,3190,,NEGATIVE,0.9964674711227417

OTLK,Very detailed &amp; thorough DD on $OTLK (Outlook Therapeutics),"**What is Outlook Therapeutics &amp; what do they do?**
* [Outlook Therapeutics is a late clinical-stage](https://outlooktherapeutics.com/about/overview/) biopharmaceutical company working to develop the first FDA-approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in approved retinal indications.
* Their goal is to launch ONS-5010 as the first and only approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab in the United States, Europe, Japan and other markets for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).

**What is ONS-5010/Lytenava?** 
* [ONS-5010 is an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab](https://outlooktherapeutics.com/lytenava-overview/) under development to be administered as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet AMD and other approved retinal diseases.
* If approved, ONS-5010 will be the first and only FDA-approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for retinal indications.

**What does their Pipeline product (ONA-5010/Lytenava) plan to treat?**
* With ONS-5010, [which will be named Lytenava](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/05/1995800/0/en/Outlook-Therapeutics-Announces-LYTENAVA-bevacizumab-vikg-Anticipated-Brand-Name-for-ONS-5010-If-Approved.html), they plan to treat:
 * Wet AMD
 * DME
 * BRVO


**What is Wet AMD?**
* Wet AMD is also known as Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration
* In [the “wet” type of macular degeneration](https://www.macular.org/wet-amd), abnormal blood vessels (known as choroidal neovascularization or CNV) grow under the retina and macula. These new blood vessels may then bleed and leak fluid, causing the macula to bulge or lift up from its normally flat position, thus distorting or destroying central vision. Under these circumstances, vision loss may be rapid and severe.
* Right now, the three standard forms of treatment for Wet AMD is **Eylea,  Lucentis &amp; Bevacizumab** [Link1](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/macular-degeneration/qa/what-are-the-treatments-for-wet-macular-degeneration) [Link 2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wet-macular-degeneration/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351113)

**What is DME?**
* It is also known as Diabetic macular edema
* In people with diabetes, too much blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels at the back inner wall of the eye (retina) or block them completely. This condition is diabetic retinopathy. Sometimes, tiny bulges (microaneurysms) protrude from the vessel walls, leaking or oozing fluid and blood into the retina. This fluid can cause swelling (edema) in the central part of the retina (macula). This is a [serious eye complication called diabetic macular edema](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/multimedia/diabetic-macular-edema/img-20124558) that can cause vision problems or blindness.
* As previously mentioned with Wet AMD, the standard form of treatment right now for patients with DME is the [use of Eylea &amp; Lucentis](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/diabetic-macular-edema-treatment)

**What is BRVO?**
* BRVO is also known as Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion
* Arteries and veins carry blood throughout your body, including your eyes. The eye’s retina has one main artery and one main vein. When branches of the retinal vein become blocked, it is called branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). When the vein is blocked, blood and fluid spills out into the retina. The macula can swell from this fluid, affecting your central vision. Eventually, without blood circulation, nerve cells in the eye can die causing a loss of vision.
* Just like the previous two, the standard form of treatment applies to BRVO as well which is [Eylea &amp; Lucentis](https://www.nvisioncenters.com/conditions/branch-retinal-vein-occlusion/)

**What are the current forms of treat for the mentioned eye diseases?**
* Current form of treatment is known as [Anti-VEGF drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322736/#s1title)
*Those Anti-VEGF drugs are: Bevacizumab, Lucentis &amp; Eylea
* Bevacizumab:
 * Bevacizumab is also known as Avastin. Avastin is the brand name for the drug, which is called bevacizumab. [It blocks the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the back of the eye.](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/drugs/avastin) Those blood vessels can leak and affect vision, causing vision loss from wet AMD and diabetic eye disease.
* Lucentis:
 * Lucentis is the brand name for the drug, which is called ranibizumab. [It works by keeping new blood vessels from forming](https://www.drugs.com/lucentis.html) under the retina (a sensory membrane that lines the inside of the eye). In people with certain types of eye disorders, new blood vessels grow under the retina where they leak blood and fluid.
* Eylea:
 * Eylea is a type of drug called a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. [It reduces leaking from blood vessels](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eylea) in the eye and slows down the growth of new blood vessels.

**How does Lytenava work as treatment?**
* It is a full-length, humanized anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) recombinant monoclonal antibody (or mAb) that [inhibits VEGF and associated angiogenic activity](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/outlook-therapeutics-announces-lytenava-bevacizumab-vikg-anticipated-brand-name-for-ons-5010-if-approved/). With wet AMD, abnormally high levels of VEGF are secreted in the eye. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new abnormal blood vessels. Anti-VEGF injection therapy blocks this growth.
* If it is approved, it will become the first FDA Approved opthalmic formulation of Bevacizumab. 
* It is a very big deal in this particular industry because the standard regular Bevacizumab [accounts for an estimated 50% of all wet AMD prescriptions in the United States](https://outlooktherapeutics.com/lytenava-overview/)

**Overview of their Pipeline Product, Lytenava**
* [If approved and commercialized for ophthalmic use, ONS-5010 has the potential to help](https://outlooktherapeutics.com/pipeline/unmet-patient-needs/) address the existing quality, safety and availability issues associated with repackaged IV bevacizumab from compounding pharmacists (e.g., cGMP-quality control issues, product shortages, inconsistent potency, sterility issues and liability risks associated with off-label, unregulated use of repackaged bevacizumab).
* ONS-5010 has the potential, if approved and commercialized with a responsible pricing strategy, to help lower the aggregate costs of treating retinal diseases for the overall healthcare system.
* Doctors who wish to treat their retinal patients with a less expensive anti-VEGF drug often use bevacizumab But because there is no FDA-approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab, doctors must use repackaged IV bevacizumab provided by compounding pharmacists. The repackaged intravenous (IV) bevacizumab for ophthalmic use that is provided by compounding pharmacies can carry known risks of contamination and inconsistent potency, with potentially severe consequences, as leading retinal societies have reported. To combat this, [Outlook firmly believes that Lytenava will avoid the potential safety, sterility, potency, availability and syringe drawbacks](https://outlooktherapeutics.com/pipeline/repackaged-bevacizumab/) that can occur with repackaged intravenous (IV) bevacizumab from compounding pharmacies.


**Current prices of the three Anti-VEGF treatments &amp; OTLK's statement regarding their projected price**
* [Bevacizumab:](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/price-difference-lucentis-and-avastin-2014-6%3famp) Average cost per dose is around $55
* [Lucentis:](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/price-difference-lucentis-and-avastin-2014-6%3famp) Average costs of $2000 per dose
* [Eylea:](https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/eylea&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmfG4kdDpAhXPrJ4KHavJB4kQFjABegQIDBAG&amp;usg=AOvVaw0v8XRHazcPNDLUpe7GqZBQ&amp;cshid=1590448291724) Average cost of around $1900 per dose
* [Lytenava:](https://outlooktherapeutics.com/pipeline/new-anti-vegf-for-ophthalmic_indications/) As stated by Outlook Therapeutics, ""Outlook Therapeutics expects to establish responsible pricing for ONS-5010, if approved. If approved for marketing, ONS-5010 has the potential to help lower the aggregate costs of treating retinal diseases for the overall healthcare system."" Seeing that **Bevacizumab** is already very cheap compared to the other two treatments, this gives you a range/estimated price of what Lytenava will be.

**Important SEC filings &amp; presentation I highly recommend you read**
* Latest [SEC Filing](https://ir.outlooktherapeutics.com/node/8706/html)
* [Corporate Presentation](https://ir.outlooktherapeutics.com/static-files/2363481b-db6a-45e7-9bcc-dbb2b90a769c)

**Risks involved**
* As with everything good in life, there are always risks present.
* One of the biggest risks is if the Topline data from the studies that will be announced in August are not good, then it will cause big problems from the company as everything that they are is behind this product being successful
* Another risk, as stated on [their latest SEC Filings:](https://ir.outlooktherapeutics.com/node/8706/html) ""On March 27, 2020, we received written notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, indicating that as of March 27, 2020, we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as the minimum bid price of our listed securities was less than $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days.""
 * They have been given until December 7th 2020 to reach compliance. If they do not reach compliance, they run the risk of being ""delisted from Nasdaq and begin trading in the over-the-counter markets if we are not successful in regaining compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards, which may negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.""

**Final thoughts &amp; comments**
* For starters, I will get this out of the way as I usually do. Please do not see the stock symbol and then blindly make purchases tomorrow when the market opens. Please read each and every single link, sec &amp; presentation I have linked to my posts.
* I want you guys to read this post and obtain as much knowledge as possible so **you** can make the best well informed decision on your own.
*Anyways, as for myself, alongside with my previous DD post, I do not have any shares in this stock. But tomorrow I will definitely purchase 500-1000 shares tomorrow as I, myself, truly am confident in this company and their products
 * I feel so confident in them because of the two new board members they've brought in, the manufacturing agreement with Fujifilm, the agreement to streamline their capital and secure 100% of net profits of future sales of Lytenava &amp; because they've been on track with their clinical studies.

Anyways, I hope this DD helped you guys make a decision on this stock if this is one that has been on your mind lately. If not, then at the very least I hope it was at least an interesting read :)

Take care everyone, hope you guys enjoy this DD.",Research,1590494722,3200,,NEGATIVE,0.9958363771438599

BNGO,Some speculation on a big move from $BNGO,"I will lay out why I'm extremely bullish on $BNGO for the coming days. They are presenting on 5/27 for a COVID conference and there is speculation of what could come before, during, or shortly after. First, we could get news on some form of acquisition from Quest. https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bionano-Corporate-Overview-April-2020_highest.pdf. See slide 8. Given Quest's acquisition history, https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/09/quest-diagnostics-history-of-acquisitions-is-payin.aspx, it certainly is a possibility. Nobody has PR'd this but we do know for sure that Quest has publicly evaluated Bionano's Saphyr. https://sec.report/Document/0001140361-20-006739/.

Onto the COVID conference. Grandomics was one of the first to use Bionano's tech and they are at the epicenter of the Wuhan outbreak, conducting large studies. They are using Bionano's tech for this study, https://twitter.com/GrandOmics/status/1237574443829846021?s=20.

There are more questions I have to ask myself and all of you. Does their unit (Saphyr) find SV's (structural variations) that others miss? Can it replace traditional Cytogenetics methods? If not, why did both Perkinelmer and Mayo Clinic adopt it recently? https://bionanogenomics.com/press-releases/bionano-genomics-announces-adoption-of-its-saphyr-system-by-clinical-cytogenetics-groups-in-academia-and-industry-to-replace-traditional-methods-for-clinical-testing/. The tech is good and complements PacBio and Illumina nicely. I believe a buy-out is just a matter of when not if. As the field of precision medicine advances, all labs will need 2-3 of these devices from Bionano.

Even if nothing big drops in the short-term (which I think some PR will), there is a conference coming and hype and momentum will drive the price on its own. Buying the rumor is the most important thing I've learned. Unconfirmed news is the best news. Just remember, this ticker went from 0.50 to 4.70 in mid October of 2019.

MARK,Are you Bullish or Gay for $MARK?,"My prediction is a spike will happen early in the week, probably Monday PM because $MARK will hype itself up over the weekend by tweeting their CEO inside well known building setting up their equipment. After the spike, so expect a drop from profit takers but will rise into earnings everyday, especially if they are active on Twitter next week. $MARK will be at $3 minimum Thursday PM. Depending how ER goes and if there’s no mention of current/future contracts or what the CEO is doing to help reopen the country, expect a drop. If a PR with contracts/customers is released, I see this stock at $4 minimum until a COVID-19 vaccine is released and even after that we may still be using the tech until most people get injected with that Bill Gates chip inside of them. Definitely bullish until mid term at least.

BAND,YOU BAND OF MERRY MEN &amp; WOMEN - REGARDING ROBINHOOD’S EXTENDED TRADING HOURS,"  

Good Afternoon My Fellow Robin Hooders,

Allow me to introduce myself. I am but a weary RobinHooder for the past many years/months. Twas Robinhood that drew me into trading due to its ease of use &amp; well-defined visuals.

However, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of watching other people make/sell shares while we, dedicated Robin Hooders, sit on the side idle, wishing/hoping we could make moves as the prices soar to the heavens or plummet to the nine depths of hell. 

Due to this inability to make said moves, I hope all of us will take the time to band together, becoming one resounding voice of merry men &amp; women united for a common cause! Allowing all our voices to ring out from the depths of Sherwood Forest to the hallowed halls within The Castle of Nottingham to say; ""Nah! We will not stand for these lousy extended hours!”

To help the common cause, all I ask is for the following:

From your desktop;

1) In Robinhood, click on the “Account” section

2) Under Account, click on “Contact Us” section

3) For the Category, select “General Questions”

4) For the Topic, select “Feature Requests”

5) Click the “Continue” button

6) Copy &amp; Paste the below information

7) Click Send

Hopefully this will make a difference!

&amp;#x200B;

Hello Robinhood,

Thank you for taking the time to read my email as I find the following “Feature Request” very important not only for myself but also for your long-standing clients and soon to be future clients.

There seems to be some major discourse taking place with your clients, myself included, regarding Robinhood’s Extended Hours, or lack thereof. I have found that more &amp; more people are leaving Robinhood due to the lack of Extended Hour trading and going to various competitors of yours. I’m sure you’re aware of which competitors I speak of, so I won’t waste your time or my time to list them.

Here are a couple of questions I would like answered:

1) Why does Robinhood only allow for Extended Trading 30mins prior to the market opening?

2) Does Robinhood plan on addressing the major issue of client retention due to the lack of Extended Hours trading?

a. If so, how?

3) As a Gold Member or potential Gold Member, could Robinhood provide Gold Members the additional capability to have additional Extended Hour trading like your competitors currently have?

I appreciate you taking the time to review and respond to my concerns.

All the Best,

MARK,"$MARK - Walmart, Disney, other big names are partnering with this AI Based Thermal Imaging company","Remark Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: MARK) is flying in the market today, and it’s nothing new. For several trading sessions, the stock has traded on either single, or double-digit gains.
The gains started when the company announced that it started shipping AI based thermal imaging technology to customers in the United States and Japan about two weeks ago. Recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), but there’s much more to this than Walmart. [article](https://alphastocknews.com/remark-holdings-mark-stock-theres-more-to-it-than-walmart/3352/)

DD done by “Informed Observer”

MARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK’s intrinsic value.

MARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK’s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.

The resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.

The Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company’s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK’s auditor has not resigned and the Company’s past audits have been qualified with “going concern” risk language, so at this point the auditor’s opinion letter can’t get much worse….unless they refuse to provide an opinion…which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.

As we get closer to MARK’s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28….market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company’s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company’s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization’s credibility.

MARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company’s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company’s rare and effective official statement of April 30.

It is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK’s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK’s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK’s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).

The value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG’s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK’s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention.",Research,1589548659,3425,,NEGATIVE,0.9955388903617859

ASRT,Very Detailed DD on $ASRT (Assertio Therapeutics),"**What is Assertio Therapeutics?**
* They are formerly known as Depomed, they have transformed theur company with a current focus on [three FDA-approved products](https://www.assertiotx.com/) in their core areas of neurology, orphan, and specialty medicines as they continue to identify, license, and develop new products that offer enhanced options for patients who may be underserved by existing therapies. 

**Assertio Pipeline Products**
* Currently, Assertio had two products that are past P3 of clinical trails and have been [Submitted to the FDA](https://www.assertiotx.com/products-and-pipeline/pipeline/)
 for approval, those products are:
- Diclofenac Potassium: Mild/moderate acute pain 12-17 years
- Long-acting Cosyntropin: Diagnosis of Adrenal Insufficiency

This is very important due to fact that if they are approved, it will provide a huge jump to their stock price/value

**Their patented technology**
* Their [patented technology is known as Acuform. It is a patented polymer-based tech designed to optimize drug delivery.](https://www.assertiotx.com/products-and-pipeline/technology/)
* Acuform technology is currently being used in multiple marketed products and being evaluated internally and with other potential partners for many additional compounds.
* With Acuform technology, unique swelling polymers allow tablets to be retained in the stomach—the preferential absorption site for many oral drugs—for 8–10 hours vs the 3 hours seen with immediate-release and some extended-release formulations.
* This gradual, extended release allows for more drug absorption in the upper GI tract, offering the potential for greater efficacy and increased tolerability, with the convenience of once- or twice-daily dosing.
* Tablets utilizing Acuform technology can be tailored to deliver new drug combinations of varying properties, either simultaneously or sequentially, for a wide array of product possibilities
* Here is a [link for the actual Acuform patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6723340B2/en) if you're interested in reading it.

**Q1 2020 Financials/reports**
* [The first Quarter of 2020](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results)
 proved to be the beginning of what is set to be an amazing year financial and medically for Assertio Therapeutics. 
* Their [EPS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/assertio-asrt-beats-q1-earnings-143502488.html)
 was .10 thus beating set EPS expectations of -.08 by 225%
*Their [revenue for Q1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/assertio-asrt-beats-q1-earnings-143502488.html)
 was $20.92 Million thus beating set revenue expectations of $11.3 Million by 85.16%

**You may wonder how/why their revenue is considered positive despite it being 30M less than the previous quarter. I'll explain why right now**
* The reason for the revenue being considered positive despite it lower than the previous quarter is due to the fact of the sales of two of their drugs to other companies

**Sales of both NUCYNTA &amp;Gralise**
* [Assertio sold NUCYNTA franchise to collegium pharmaceuticals](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/06/1981407/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Announces-Sale-of-NUCYNTA-Franchise-to-Collegium-Pharmaceutical-for-375-0-Million.html) for a total of $375 million dollars in addition, they also paid for inventory relating to NUCYNTA
* [They sold Gralise to Alvogen](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/12/1959802/0/en/Assertio-Therapeutics-Announces-Sale-of-Gralise-for-Total-Transaction-Value-of-127-5-Million.html) for a total of $127.5 Million dollars, plus inventory
* Sold both for a combined total of [$502.5 Million dollars](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results)

**Why the sale of two high earning products is amazing &amp; what it sets up for Q2-Q4 of 2020**
* With the combined sale of NUCYNTA &amp; Gralise for $502M, Assertio was able to [repay their senior debt in full](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/assertio-therapeutics-announces-closing-of-sale-of-nucynta-franchise-to-collegium-pharmaceutical-for-375-0-millionalso-announces-its-senior-secured-debt-has-been-repaid-in-full/)
* Repaying their Senior debt in full is amazing because with the sale closing and the accelerated repayment of their senior debt obligations, it allows Assertio Therapeutics the ability to invest in their core business which will help them build and grow for the future. 
* [the Company has also retired substantially all of its outstanding Convertible Notes](http://investor.assertiotx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/assertio-therapeutics-announces-first-quarter-2020-results) through $188.0 million of privately negotiated purchase agreements and a tender of an additional $76.7 million.

**Final thoughts &amp; comments**
* As I always tell you guys, this is just a very detailed post containing as much useful information I could find and write about so you guys can read and make your own well informed decision. At the end of the day, it is upto you if you decide to purchase shares and how much you'll purchase. What I'm doing for you is that I want to give you guys the best knowledge possible before you make your decision.

* I genuinely believe in their products and I believe in their CEOs and I believe in the merger. 
* The way they are handling and changing courses for this year has been incredibly successful so far &amp; the proof is there with those sales and with beating set expectations of them by wide margins.
* Not only that, but theyre responsible with the new large amounts of cash they've received and the proof is there with them fully paying off their debt
* [Plus the CEOs of Assertio &amp; Zyla who will be running the newly merged company have 25 &amp; 35 years of experience and have previously held high ranking positions](http://investor.assertiotx.com/static-files/81290326-b4a8-4156-872b-6e90487dcbdd) with Bayer, Abbot Laboratories pharmaceutical division, Enzon pharmaceuticals &amp; Horizon Therapeutics

* For those reasons mentioned above, I firmly believe this company will be trading higher than the $1.35 target price.
* I personally own 600 shares of $ASRT
* I'll be holding these shares through Q2-Q4

Upside $20+ by end of 2020 if FDA decision is positive. Downside is basically all the way to zero if FDA is denied. Spikes to $8 are possible and have occurred on random news events.

No options available due to it being a tiny company. It was trading at close to book value (cash on hand) after the market tanked. It has been heavily shorted for a long time and sombrero coveting is one thing that causes the price spikes.

My strategy is to buy and hold until FDA decision.",None,1589393675,3487,,NEGATIVE,0.9991718530654907

BCRX,$BCRX is quite an interesting play,"They are another biotech company but are more expensive than most of the tickers here. But they tend to swing to $8 and higher. This time they are likely to surpass $10.

They have major plays with their own proprietary Galidesivir, a potential COVID-19 cure/vaccine. It’s almost like the one from Gilead, Remdesivir. You should know by now that Donnie Trump is supporting Remdesivir as a COVID-19 vaccine.

There is also one drug in their pipeline, which is awaiting approval from the FDA. I read that this is a kind of a breakthrough and they’ll likely be bought out by another major biotech.

Today’s dip causes the stock price to plummet (this happens often and is really a good stock to swing with). They are present at the Bank of America Healthcare Conference, tomorrow. [Bank of America](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biocryst-present-upcoming-investor-conferences-110010982.html) Perhaps, they will update us with the Phase 1 of Galidesivir.

TL;DR: Price is low today, there’s a conference tomorrow, may be good for a swing opportunity.

NVAX,BCRX (Potential Next NVAX),"**Ticker:** BCRX
**Ticker's Most Recent Price:** $6.10
**Comment:** I've been doing some research into finding the next NVAX for us. I recall reading that Gilead had competition and I started looking at other adenosine analogues that are being tested right now, with GILD's Remdesivir being the most known one currently. I came across Galidesivir, and it is made by the publicly traded company BioCryst (BCRX) - there are other adenosine analogues but they didn't have anything noteworthy going on. It looks like BCRX is currently conducting and winding down a clinical study in Brazil, so results should be posted soon in the coming days/weeks (estimated study completion date is 5/31/21, and they started in April). 

This is just pure speculation and hypothesis, but looking at the molecular data for both drugs, I would think that Galidesivir is the more stable of the two since it can be stored at a higher temperature in powder form without denaturing. Also, it being easier to store would potentially make it the more popular of the two, especially in clinics where getting a medical grade freezer (that reaches -20 to -80C) may be hard. For reference, Galidesivir can be stored at +4C in powder form unlike Remdesivir which must be stored in the aforementioned range. Furthermore, if we look at the molecular weights of the two drugs, we see that Galidesivir is much lighter, and lower molecular weights are generally correlated with an increase in biological activity of the drug (better uptake). In layman's terms, I would think that the results from Galidesivir's study will be good, if not better than GILD's Remdesivir study.",Research,1589356820,3508,,NEGATIVE,0.9986261129379272

STKL,"Ticker to watch: $STKL, SunOpta foods. 35+% anticipated gains from planned entry/exit.","I mentioned earlier that I would try to get my current DD out tonight, and here it is. Similar to my last post, I do not currently have a position and am watching this week for the appropriate entry point. Link to my earlier post with results from previous DD post on 04/23: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/gi00od/amrx\_up\_47\_since\_post\_update\_0511/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/gi00od/amrx_up_47_since_post_update_0511/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

**My intention for my posts is to provide enough info,** ***with enough time*****, for you to follow up with your own DD and make a high-quality decision before the gains occur. Post is my opinion only and not a suggestion to buy. Current position: None. Intended position: 2% of portfolio 2-4 weeks.** 

$STKL – SunOpta: Plant and fruit based foods and proprietary processes; Current price: $3.48

Where originally found: Big money screener - Looks for highly rated, inexpensive companies with strong price momentum. This screen first selects only companies that have a favorable or neutral analyst ranks, a Strong Buy broker rating, and a good Price/Sales ratio. Next, only the stocks with the strongest price movements are kept.

Reason to investigate further: Crossed 50 day moving average on 04/17 and has shown no signs of stopping once that resistance line was broken. 15% recent consistent increase in volume.

Quick FA: Recent earnings growth over previous quarters. Each of it’s business units has proprietary products and services that give it a solid competitive advantage in its sector. Zacks industry rank 1st out 44. &gt;70% Held by institutions. Excellent value at current prices to sales .32 and price to book of 2.33.

What I like: The technical setup of the stock is supportive of higher prices. The stock has outperformed the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&amp;P 500. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days, indicating that STKL is under accumulation. Short term fundamentals. Analyst consensus strong buy/buy with recent upgrades as recently as of today, 05/11.

**What I do not like: Price has already jumped significantly. Expected earnings disaster in August after previous growth. Not a lot of FA to work with here. Insider buying came to an end recently around 04/24 at an average price range of 2-2.50 according to Vickers. This boat may have already sailed.**

Decision and trade idea: Rare personal decision to trade mostly on recent technical analysis and assumption fundamental trend will remain and new price channel is forming until earnings. Head and shoulders inverse completed on 05/03 and has been running ever since. Short term - intermediate trade only without major news or turnaround. What I am looking for Tuesday: Pullback in price as RSI is exiting oversold territory. Ideal entry point: $3.29 or lower. Stop loss 10% below buy in. Price target and planned exit 4 – 4.50 for a risk/reward ratio of 1:5.

Additional notes: Stop buy placed at 3.65 as potential risk vs reward starts to diminish. Will reassess every 10%. I personally wont take a position Tuesday unless it dips to my buy target of 3.29 or better. I have been looking to add food industries to my portfolio, but not restaurants. This does have long term potential if they can put out some PR to help me feel like Q2 wont be a complete disaster. Currently also added similar, but not penny stock, MGPI to my portfolio.

I look forward to any complimentary or contradictory discussion if you have looked at this ticker yourself, or just have an opinion on the DD. Please feel free to post additional tickers you may want me to look at for my next post. Happy trading!",Discussion,1589249113,3555,,NEGATIVE,0.9985014200210571

CHFS,"[DD] $CHFS – sleeper COVID play, earnings tomorrow","CHF Solutions ($CHFS) makes a FDA-approved device called Aquadex that filter excess fluid out of your bloodstream. The machine sells for $31,000, but the real money-maker is the $900 filters that get changed regularly and between patients. 

Why is this a COVID play? Because COVID causes fluid imbalances in your body that are difficult to manage. With Aquadex, your doctor hooks you up to the filter and it manages the water content of your bloodstream automatically. [The WHO designated fluid management as a key problem in effective COVID treatment.](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/330893)

Before COVID, CHF struggled to get these things into hospitals. But now, Aquadex units are selling like hotcakes. CHF has had to [rapidly scale up their production](http://ir.chf-solutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chf-solutions-doubles-production-staff-aquadex-smartflowtm) to keep up with demand. In NYC alone, they have [increased the number of units by 300%.](http://ir.chf-solutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chf-solutions-announces-300-increase-utilization-aquadex-therapy) Doctors love these things because the automated fluid management frees up MD/nurse staff/dialysis so they can treat the trillion other patients flooding their ER. It also more controlled than diuretic medications and avoids side effects. Once the units are in hospitals, they will get used and those $900 filters keep getting rolled out the door. 

This company has a dogged history. It struggled to get on its feet early on, flip-flopping between products and reverse splitting its stock to hell to stay compliant. Further, they really failed in marketing a great product. If you look at their balance sheet for last year, they burn tons of cash on admin and marketing without much to show for it. I think, for those reasons, a lot of investors – myself included – were or are not bullish on management long-term. However, COVID is turning out to be the exposure they needed to push product and for once they are actually rising to the opportunity and pushing. 

The play is to pick up shares (if you pick up tomorrow at pre-market opening, you'll be in before earnings are released) now. You can dump after earnings, or hold for the duration of COVID – their next quarter will be probably also be stellar. 

My position: $CHFS x 2000 long, (although I might pick up a couple thousand more pre-market tomorrow).",Research,1589225865,3563,,NEGATIVE,0.9956788420677185

REAL,"TIPS: How to create a REAL stock DD, and how to spot a ""Pump &amp; Dump"" scam post","There have been TOO MANY retarded posts on here that look something like ""GUYS!!!  ""Laughing Corporation"" (ticker: LMAO) is gonna HIT THE MOON!!  It's only $.32, I think it'll hit $100 by tomorrow!!  BUY BUY BUY I'm already a majority shareholder with 307% ownership of stock!!!  They just announced a new product! (insert link of sketchy website with penis pill ads).""

This is not how you do a DD, this is the sign of a pump scam.  How many have there been here?  $MVIS, $RTTR, $UAVS... need I go on?  However, I don't want this sub to go to hell and become a total shitshow like r/pennystocks did, where half the posts are scams, so I want to give you guys some tips on how to write a DD, and separate the good ones from the fucking stupid ones:

1. State the company, their sector, and why their stock price is so low.  Let's face it: if a stock is a penny stock, the company is either new as a baby or just downright a shitty investment.  And there's no way that we on this sub, a bunch of sweaty losers with the collective IQ of a squirrel, have more vision or insight than Blackrock or Goldman Sachs, unless you can give us solid proof.  State WHY the stock price is so low, and why that is an opportunity to invest, don't give vague descriptions of products or mergers or why the company is great.  State the company's vision, products, developments, and FIND LEGITIMATE SOURCES.  If you've never heard of the publication, guess what?  It's probably not the most reliable source.
2. Do a quick rundown of the last quarterly financials, or at least credible speculation of the next earnings call.  If you don't know how to read an SEC filing, LEARN IT.  It takes 3 hours and is the single most useful thing to learn when you want to value a company, because that's what investing is, valuing the worth of a company, not gambling that the price will go up.
3. Look at the company technicals.  RSI, MACD, Stochastic k% or D%, etc.  Again, if you don't know how to read these, LEARN IT because it takes an hour and dictates how you will conduct most of your trades.  Let's forget that MVIS was a scam for a second.  Judging by the prices some of you bought in when the RSI reading was at 85%, meaning you just fucked your wallet without lube because you couldn't spend 2 minutes (this isn't an exaggeration of time, it literally takes 2 minutes) reading a couple of indicators.  This determines whether the current price you're buying at is a true bargain, or if you either A; missed the best time to buy, or B; should wait for the right time to buy.  State the technicals here.  Here's a tip: use TradingView if you don't already look at indicators.  It's free and you can use up to 3 indicators with the free version.

Any stock DD that lacks 2 of the 3 things stated here IS PROBABLY A SCAM, PUMP &amp; DUMP, OR SHITTY INVESTMENT.  On top of tips on this sub, please Do Your Own Research (DYOR).  It will save your ass and your wallet from getting fucked.  Confirm what people say, double then triple check, and enter at your own peril.  Don't point fingers at other users and claim they're guilty of your Limited Edition Red Color Trading Account (Patent pending).  Another thing to look out for: anyone that tries to use FOMO to get you to buy a position.  Never, NEVER EVER buy a position because you're scared of missing out on profits, the stock market will always have profitable plays while it exists, missing out on one is better than the potential of getting demolished.  I know this is basic investing for many of you guys, but I also know there are a ton of people here that downloaded RobinHood because it was free or their retarded friends gave them an affiliate link, and only know how to make a buy and sell order, so this is the easiest way to be able to understand what people are talking about in their DD.  Good luck out there!",None,1588973917,3617,,NEGATIVE,0.9997040629386902
MVIS,Some Post DD on MVIS by a newb...Beware,"So as I'm learning and reading things I came across the SEC form DEFA14A that MVIS filed. Now anyone who listened to the earnings call heard the words reverse split. That's scary enough as it is but the call wasn't clearest of quality on my end so after reading this new SEC filing know this. Per SEC regulation they need their stock to maintain a share $1 for 10 consecutive days in order to remain listed. MVIS is literally calling a vote to reverse split their stock in order to avoid delisting. 

Now, just because a company gets delighted doesn't mean its not profitable. That being said their 1st quarter earnings missed their mark by 55.15%. 

BUT THE PATENT AND BUYOUT WITH MSFT!! 

You can look at this two ways. First is that MSFT sees a dwindling company that they can take advantage of and buy out super cheap to help them avoid being delisted or worse. Second is the MSFT wants nothing more than their patented tech with no intention of buying out the company. Why else would the Execs of MVIS even discuss a reverse split if MSFT merger buyout was on the table. There would be no point in filing with the SEC as they would know they are getting bought. 

This second option is my stance and why I am going to be steadfast and NOT jump back into the MVIS bandwagon next week ahead of the shareholders meeeting. The choice is yours. Red Pill or Blue?",Research,1588970479,3618,,NEGATIVE,0.9992672801017761
TOPS,So whats the deal with TOPS?,"Looking at their 5 year chart, they managed an impressive feat. Going from over $75000 per share, to worth 0.22 per share.

I assume this is because they just kept issuing out more and more shares, devaluing each share like crazy. My question is why? Sure they would have brought in some money with each issuance of shares, but eventually people would stop giving them money for worthless shares, right?

KTOV,$KTOV DD and potential growth in the short term,"This is a Israeli Pharm company with an FDA approved drug called Consensi (FDA approved in 2018) with recent 10 million registered direct offer

TEL-AVIV, Israel, May 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kitov Pharma Ltd. (“Kitov”) (NASDAQ/TASE: KTOV), a clinical-stage company advancing first-in-class therapies to overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with several institutional and accredited investors for the purchase and sale of 25,000,002 of the Company’s ordinary shares represented by American Depositary Shares (ADSs), at a purchase price of $0.40 per ADS, in a registered direct offering, for ***aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10 million.*** 

Kitov has also agreed to issue to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 25,000,002 ADSs. Each ADS represents one ordinary share, no par value, of Kitov. The offering is expected to close on or about May 8, 2020, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

""Kitov intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund the development of its oncology drug candidates, acquisition of new assets and for general working capital purposes"" 

The new drug, (consensi), will be making a debut mid next week (i believe the 5/15). It's a combo drug of amlodipine and colchicine, essentially a hypertensive and arthritic  combo med. 

I'm bullish on this one with caps of 0.4, not sure if it will go ""to the moon"" but a solid 10% gain is pretty real. Volume is high today at 39.78M which is about 2.5x MKT CAP. It's getting a lot of PR over on stocktwits and [Sabby Management  just purchased 8.3 million stock today](https://fintel.io/i/sabby-management-llc)

MVIS,IZEA Up Next? (After MVIS Hype),"As you all know, MVIS is the ""big thing"" when it comes to these forums, as of late.

But after Thursday, the company will either go big time and partner with MS and hit a reverse split (MS will buy out the company and MVIS will hit a split), or the partnership will end up being a fluke and the share price will dropped drastically (like UAVS did, scary stuff).

After this week, MVIS will be forgetton about, either way. IZEA has been getting some talks and rumors, I'm thinking that it's the next co to look out for. They have their rumored partnership with Twitch and two upcoming events, coming on the 14th and 18th of the month. With that news, I think this will be a really good buy. Got in at $.50 and I'm most likely holding until the 16th. Thoughts?

MVIS,$MVIS: A Micro-vision of Microvision,"I micro-dosed some LSD this weekend and summoned Plutus, the Greek God of wealth. I wept at his feet and pleaded he bless me with the truth about Microvision. Here is how the prophecy unfolded.

Me: ""Is it true thy beloved father Plutus? Microsoft shall extend it's green olive branches to Microvision? Tis there more? O dear Plutus! I beg ye fill me with thou wisdom!""

Plutus: ""Tis true indeed my son. And hath been all along. Microvision and Microsoft hath been sharing nutrients between their roots and shall soon merge as one technological tree.

MVIS,"NAT Losses, MVIS opportunity","Friday AH made me hopeful for this morning. Put in a sell order for my shares first thing tomorrow morning because they are still up. However my calls are getting shit stomped to oblivion. Down 50% and considering cutting losses. They expire in June which makes me want to continue to hold them in hopes that i can at least mitigate some of my losses but at this point it might turn to a 100% loss. Opinions? Take the expensive lesson or hold out in hopes that my losses may decrease in the coming months?

When I look GUSH through Robinhood, is the total return already factoring in the RS, including potential equity loss? I feel like I lost money but I honestly can't remember, and the total return claims to be a positive value. I'm wondering if everything is scaled according to the RS, or if there is a loss of information. This stock in particular gives me heart palpitations and I'm ready to dip out and take my profit... if what I see is real. 

OK, as I was typing this I think my question became clearer, so here's about what I'm wondering:

So if someone had 79 shares before the 1:40 RS, they'd only get 1 afterward (unless they round up to 2). Let's say they get 1. Does the lost 39 just vanish from visible history on Robinhood?

But by time robinhood get a chance I recommend buying all in. Volume premarket is 150k. Volume at 9 am easily will surpass 100 million. Again I can’t stress this enough . SELL WHEN YOU’RE POSITIVE. If you’d like. Go back in once a dip happens {and it will happen}. I believe it will dip lower than 70 cents but who’s to tell. Buy and sell same day. If you feel like it’s going to do way better, which it might. Sell half your stock and put a limit loss of at least 5% of your gain. So if it goes up 45% sell and put a stop loss at 40%.

But for the people who keep up with Xbox projects the most recent project revealed by Xbox was [project Osiris ](https://youtu.be/PNAAjMFZaAA) which is an all in one projector, speaker, and assistant. MVIS specializes in projection technology and one key feature that project Osiris notes in its trailer is having the ability for the projector to detect the wall and project an image based on the size of the wall.

APPS,Very detailed DD on APPS. Enjoy!,"**APPS, also known as Digital Turbine**, is a company that works at the convergence of media and mobile communications, delivering end-to-end products and solutions for mobile operators, device OEMs and other third parties to enable them to effectively monetize mobile content. 

Essentially what Digital Turbine does is [this](https://www.digitalturbine.com/about/):  They makes it easier than ever for people to frictionlessly discover new apps, for operators and OEMs to build new revenue streams, and for advertisers to reach users at scale.

The past three quarters have [proved to show consistently strong numbers](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/financials), quarter after quarter and year after year. This past earnings call for their most recent quarter was posted back in February on the 10th. Their third quarter revenue was $36 Million which is the company's **all time** high revenue and it shows an **18% growth** when compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2019. 

Even better, they reported a $12.5 Million **growth** in their cash balance and they reported **ZERO DEBT.**  [Here is the DD on what i have said in terms to their growth and zero debt report.](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results)

Not only did Digital Turbine post incredibly positive earnings, reporting their all time high revenue, they also confirmed an acquisition. APPS purchased ""Mobile Posse"" for a reported $66 Million. This is incredibly well done business for multiple reasons.

*  They achieved 2019 revenue of $59.1 million, a GAAP Net Income of $4.5 million and a Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 million 
* They have reported rapid revenue and profitability growth over the past 5+ years 
* They  have a highly profitable, recurring business model with gross margins approaching 50% and EBITDA margins in excess of 20% 
* The acquisition of Mobile Posse brings Digital Turbine **strategic partners which are Tmobile and Metro PCS**

The best part of everything i have just mentioned is that it will be reflected during their next earnings call which is on [June 1st](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/apps/earnings). Here is all the [DD on everything i had just mentioned regarding APPS acquisition of Mobile Posse.](https://content.equisolve.net/_dd96bc3559702235d3af3b6271f3a98c/digitalturbine/db/199/1884/pdf/Mobile+Posse+Investor+Summary+FINAL.pdf)

Another thing that has flown under the radar that they have recently done is this: [On February 10th](https://ir.digitalturbine.com/press-releases/detail/589/digital-turbine-reports-fiscal-2020-third-quarter-results), Digital Turbine announced their new Global distribution with LG Electronics. This is huge deal for APPS, it'll definitely be reflected upon their next earnings call and all i can see from this distribution partnership is an increase in revenue. The distribution partnership plus the acquisition of Mobile Posse, all this will do is increase their revenue by a ton. It's amazing news, but yet both of these have gone under the radar.

**Target Prices &amp; forecasts:**

* After everything i have just mentioned, canaccord genuity  analyst Andrew Moldow increased Digital Turbine's [target price](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-digital-turbine-stock-jumped-wednesday-2020-03-04) from $8 to $12 dollars.
* Finviz currently sets APPS [target price](https://www2.finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APPS&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d) to $10
* CNN money currently has [6 analysts offering a price forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=APPS) for Digital Turbine Inc at a median price target of $10.00, with a high estimate of $12.00 and a low estimate of $7

**My final thoughts and comments on this stock/company:**

* I personally have invested $1000 into APPS, i bought 262 shares a month ago on April 2nd when i first began hearing about this company.
* I have also bought several long calls a month ago that have already been raking in profits for me as well. 
* I genuinely do believe that they will reach $10-15 by the end of the year. I believe so because of all their recent acquisitions and partnerships they have made, plus they have zero debt and they reported their highest ever revenue the previous quarter.
* They are so close to $7 dollars, which is CNNs lowest estimate price target, which again adds to why i believe they will reach past the $10 mark

At the end of the day, this is just thorough research on APPS. What you decide to do, whether purchase or not. Or if you do decide to purchase and you buy a little or a lot, thats all on you. Like I tell everyone, Please do your own DD as well before you ever hit submit when purchase a stock or an option.

Please read the articles and links i have clipped into this DD so you can have all the knowledge possible to make a well informed decision.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this DD helps you out and i hope you liked it :) Have a great weekend guys!! :)

TBLT,I hereby declare this post as the $TBLT megathread,"$TBLT

About a month ago, this stock was worth around $0.14-$0.15 per share. They had a 10:1 reverse split in order to bump up the cost per share and avoid delisting from the exchange. At the moment, the cost per share is fluctuating around $1.2-$1.3.

As far as news goes, all I really know is that they reported positive numbers on their last earnings report and apparently they've been making decent profits on Amazon market.

I'm also aware that they have a business contract with Lowe's which is expected to come into effect in October. The contract mentioned something like $20M, TBLT branded products supposed to enter Lowe's ecosystem and they're also supposed to handle some of Lowe's own product under the Cobalt brand.

If you have any other news about this stock (or Lowe's since that would have some effect) let everyone know!

I'm planning to hold this stock until mid October and at that point sell it all if there's no positive change",Discussion,1588339765,4023,,NEGATIVE,0.9942761063575745

VISL,My DD on VISL,"VISL, they are a company known for their array of well produced products in the wireless Telecom industry. They have work with a vast majority of companies and the military as well. 

*One of their more recent &amp; great news that has gone under the radar is the immediate recruitment of Jim McGowan as their Vice President &amp; Manager of VISL MiliGov division. This man has decades of experience dealing with military contracts and before joining VISL he was the vice president of FLIR systems, a company that has a $5 Billion dollar market cap. The recruitment of Jim McGowan is going to prove to be very smart business with all the clients he will bring to VISL.
[DD on his recruitmentt](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/23/2005120/0/en/Vislink-Technologies-Appoints-Jim-McGowan-as-Vice-President-and-General-Manager-of-its-MilGov-Business-Unit.html)

*Their recent contract bids that have been accepted. Sure, you can go ahead and say it is a relatively small contract considering the industry they are in, but look at who they are contracted with. It's a small sheriff's department &amp; guess who got them the contract in the first place? **Jim McGowan**. This shows that despite the COVID-19 outbreak, this company is still putting in solid work &amp; after they complete this project, with the help of **Jim McGowan**, they will continue getting government and military contracts. He just barely joined at the end of March and won them this government contract. 
[DD on this contract](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-wins-a-99285-00-project-to-replace-existing-infrastructure-to-our-new-ciras-6-way-all-integrated-receiver-and-antenna-system-for-sheriffs-department/) 

*Their most recent bid was accepted, thus beating out all the other competitors. As many of you may have heard, VISL was chosen as the company to provide live high definition &amp; uninterrupted video board systems for the Ferrari race series. This is a prestigious contract, this shows that they are clearly capable of making solid supplies in order to even accomplish this. This shows that if the event coordinators believe in their technology, we should too. This contract will certainly turn heads when it comes to bidding on more contracts in the future and it goes to show that this company can work in any industry such as sporting events to military contracts.
[DD on theor most recent contracts contract](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-chosen-to-provide-high-definition-live-on-board-video-systems-for-the-prestigious-european-ferrari-challenge-race-series/)


*Alongside their most recent contracts, if you look their recent history YTD, they are all over the world winning government contract bids &amp; making a name for themselves. With most companies reporting loss in profits, VISL is working hard &amp; continuously beat their competitors due to the quality of their technology.

They will certainly delivery on their next stockholders meeting. This meeting will be on [May 8th](https://www.vislink.com/vislink-technologies-inc-to-hold-remote-annual-meeting-of-stockholders-on-new-date/)

*SEC filings: on 4/23/2020 VISL filed an 8K form, it only be bad if they were going bankrupt, but they are not. This form is directly correlated to DEFA14A they filed on 4/21/2020 which is the shareholders meeting that will take place next Friday, May 8th. This goes to show that they are planning to let the shareholders know some big news, possibly the amount the contract they signed with the coordinators of the Ferrari event or a new contract they are keeping a lid on. Either way, the 8K filing should be good news next Friday. [8K](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14090499&amp;RcvdDate=4/23/2020&amp;CoName=VISLINK%20TECHNOLOGIES,%20INC.&amp;FormType=8-K&amp;View=html)

*In the past two weeks on their company website, they share news of their current contract acquisitions &amp; each time they released something positive, their value flew up (albeit a small change) but still, it's a positive change. [Correlation](https://pasteboard.co/J6gfJAu5.png)

*They currently have a Target price set at $1 and with analysts holding a forecast of a high of $10. I don't believe it will reach $10 on the next 12months, but I strongly believe it will reach a dollar soon and be over a dollar by the end of the year.

At the end of the day, it's a relatively cheap stock, it's trading at 34 cents. You can buy 100 shares right now for 34 dollars right now. I personally bought 200 shares. Because if I'm worng, this will drop back down give or take .25 cents which is where I bought my 200 shares. But if I'm right, then I'll make solid profit. Because it's cheap, I'm okay with purchasing 200 shares.

Anyy, that's my take on VISL. I personally think it's a strong buy &amp; if tomorrow there's a dip, I'll buy more. 

Take care &amp; as always, if you have doubts always do some DD on your own to make sure you're okay with purchasing whatever stock you decide to buy. Gg fellas :)",Discussion,1588277253,4035,,POSITIVE,0.9988967180252075

RIGL,The play: $RIGL or Rigel Pharmaceuticals.,"# Rigel Pharmaceuticals is a biotech stock that is set to blow. 

Their primary product, a drug called Tavalisse treats Chronic immune thrombocytopenia, a horrible autoimmune disorder. Rigel is partnered with Grifols($GRFS) and together they're releasing Tavalisse into Europe in a year, and once this happens, Rigel triggers a 20 million dollar payment from their partner Grifols. When this drug drops into Europe, we can expect the 20 million to help clear up any outstanding debt(which happens with R&amp;D) and they can start clearing more profit from the drug alone and put more money into other ventures.

# COVID-19 Related Profit

We've also seen a company this week that is linked to Rigel announce a Corona virus recovery treatment that is being fast tracked to approval in the UK([Here](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/uks_new_covid-19_trial_initiative_fast-tracks_bergenbios_bemcentinib_1339339)), Bergen Bio and their drug Bemcentinib was actually developed by Rigel and licensed from Rigel, and earns a **35%** royalty on its uses due to a 2011 agreement([Here](https://www.rigel.com/pipeline/partnered-assets/bergenbio/)). What does this mean? Further profit, lower debts, and as we all know what happens with any COVID news, the share prices can moon once the market reflects this data. Rigel is a relatively small stock, which related to the bigger winner here Bergen Bio, but still this will show us positive effects in terms of income and likely news once this conference call occurs on **May 5th Tuesday after market close**.

# Who thinks this is worth buying?

JP Morgan set a price target of **7$** for RIGL, the price has run **up 16%** roughly as of this writing the past week in expectation of positive earnings news, and **84% of the company is owned by institutional investors**, guys who do this for a living, with FMR having 13.55% ownership, Wellington at almost 10%, Blackrock with 8.73%, and Vangaurd at 5.24%. Regardless of your price target, this company sees promise in the eyes of large institutions, and you should see it too.

# What should you do?

Buying and holding shares is one route, another route is doing the longest dated calls, as they're very cheap at the moment, at the current prices, they're a steal.

# TL;DR

# Rigel is accumulating more income in the next year from Tavalisse with a Europe release, a drug it produced and has royalties on is being fast tracked for COVID-19 treatments, and big investors see potential.

UAVS,Why I'm selling my $UAVS shares ASAP this morning,"I started trading a couple months ago. I, like many others, thought pennystocks sounded exciting. And, like most others, I got burned. Not badly - about a $150 loss all around, but I learned my lesson and I mostly quit, and moved on to bigger stocks and, lastly now, long-term ETF/indexes. 

I bought a few shares of UAVS - less than 50, when it just first started getting traction with some uninvested money I had leftover. But I'm selling this morning, here's my thought process:

* The market is always forward-thinking 

* The market might be focused, right now, on the news of them working with an ""e-commerce"" company and how it could be Amazon - it might be, it might not be

* I'm already up 211% - that is INSANE, but ultimately, like any penny stock, it isn't magical

* If the market is forward-thinking, then (IMO) immediately after the call, it will shift to ""Okay, but how will they actually implement drone delivery for the company?"" - this is the key in my train of thought 

* I think it'll either not be Amazon, the implementation will be slow/restricted, or both, which could stall any further growth and/or begin the dump 

* I'm going to make the difficult decision to not be greedy, and happily take my 200% profit, and use it towards buying another share of QQQ or VOO

And who knows, maybe I'm wrong. I almost definitely could be. I could, and may lose on some more profit. But I'm training myself to be happy with good gains for any future penny stocks I dip in, and moving on.

While it has been bouncing around it, it has never broken the threshold. Having been as high as $.91 earlier this week, I believe a rebound is likely.

MBRX,$MBRX has me believing that DD doesn't actually matter with penny stocks and that this is all luck.,"Last week there was good news with WP1122 and they're supposed to be going into clinical trials with it soon. Today they added a member to their science advisory board who has a long list of accomplishments.

I'm really jaded over this. I'll admit, I'm no more than a medium-beginner with this whole game but when you do DD and there's exclusively good news and the stock just continues to drop, I have a hard time understanding why. The only thing I can think of that's causing drops is this..

&gt; Moleculin Biotech has attempted to identify forward-looking statements by terminology including ''believes,'' ''estimates,'' ''anticipates,'' ''expects,'' ''plans,'' ''projects,'' ''intends,'' ''potential,'' ''may,'' ''could,'' ''might,'' ''will,'' ''should,'' ''approximately'' or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking statements.  

So maybe I'm not looking for an overarching general answer to this question, but a specific one. Why is MBRX continuing to drop when they're pumping out nothing but good news? Does the statement above really have such bearing that it should fall 21% over a week? And when should I pull the plug? I put in at 1.29.",Rants,1587565812,4215,,NEGATIVE,0.9921602606773376

IBIO,$IBIO stock news. Did we overlook this?,"Looks promising!  Ready for another ride?!

“The company asserts that IBIO-200 offers better dose definition. Just as importantly, this promising vaccine may provide higher product yields. That relates to the aforementioned scalability advantage of the FastPharming method. Any coronavirus vaccine that’s approved and brought to market would need to be produced in massive quantities.

IBio claims that Ibio-200 would feature “fast scalability to tens of millions of doses,” while still maintaining a high standard of quality. It’s amazing to consider that a plant-based technological breakthrough could end up saving many human lives. Yet, FastPharming and Ibio-200 may be a game changer in the biotech space.”

IBIO,"Watch out for these stocks $IBIO, $OPGN and more!","# Another week, another chance to get f*cked.

To minimalize my chances for screwing up big time, I've done some DD's over the weekend. The stocks are summed below and you may decide whether to jump in or let it pass.

I'm not an expert nor a professional. Take my opinions with a grain of salt. It's always recommended to do your own research and stand behind your own decisions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**$IBIO:**

* Pharma company focused on providing product development and manufacturing services for third parties [\[1\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBIO?p=IBIO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* Their fast pharming platform shortens the timeline of production and has a large production capacity [\[2\]](https://www.ibioinc.com/pipeline).
* On Feb 03, 2020, $IBIO initiate a joint development with CC-pharming from Beijing [\[3\]](https://ir.ibioinc.com/press-releases/detail/120/ibio-and-cc-pharming-initiate-joint-development-of).
* The COVID-19 vaccine is at the beginning of its pre-clinical stage.
* The company has three other products, of which two are in the beginning stage of pre-clinical, in development. The classical swine fever is at its late-stage before product registration [\[2\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBIO?p=IBIO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* $IBIO’s past shows great success around 2010. This was also a pump or dump. The stock went from $0.20 to $6. Since then the stock went downwards and resulted in a reverse split [\[4\]](https://seekingalpha.com/article/251696-ibio-overvalued).
* A week ago, they announced a collaboration with the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) in which they want to advance the development of the vaccine [\[5\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibio-expands-covid-19-vaccine-113010653.html). The IDRI is a nonprofit and is known to have a deeper understanding of infectious diseases and vaccine development [\[6\]](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/education-training/phd-pathobiology/infectious-disease-research-institute).
* News are released frequently.
* **Conclusion**: $IBIO is on board to create a possible COVID-19 vaccine. Their fast pharming platform and previous collaborations could increase the stock value in the near term. A positive announcement about the COVID-19 development may come within three weeks. I’m bullish on the company. Long term holding (until the pandemic is gone) might not be a great idea if we’re looking at their current balance sheet and chart history.

**$DYNT:**

* Health care company designing, manufacturing and marketing orthopedics, physical therapy, rehabilitation, pain management and athletic training products in the USA and internationally [\[7\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DYNT?p=DYNT).
* The company produces $60M+ yearly in revenue. The earnings are barely negative but is steadily increasing each year.
* Whilst unprofitable, $DYNT has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years if it maintains its current positive free cash flow [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-dynt/dynatronics#cash-runway).
* Although $DYNT is a healthcare stock, COVID-19 has a negative impact on the sales of $DYNT [\[9\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dynatronics-corporation-provides-preliminary-third-113000355.html).
* No frequent PR
* Some monthly activity on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook
* At an all-time low.
* New chief financial officer (CFO) [\[10\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dynatronics-appoints-john-krier-chief-140000420.html).
* Chart history shows that the stock is well-known for its sudden spikes [\[11\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dynt).
* **Conclusion:** $DYNT has a wide variety of products in different healthcare fields. The company is making acceptable negative earnings, and can withstand their business for more than 3 years; it could likely survive the backlash caused by the virus. They recently have a new CFO, trying to adapt to the current situation and are looking forward to increasing revenue. In my opinion, the stock is a buy and has a high likelihood to bounce back over the $1.

**$ZOM:**

* Pharma company for animals (dogs, cats, and horses) [\[12\]](https://zomedica.com/).
* No revenues or product [\[13\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZOM/financials?p=ZOM).
* Low price, but will likely go through a reverse split or get delisted.
* Not regularly bringing out the news.
* **Conclusion:** Company is at its all-time low. Not going to be a profitable company in the short term. A pandemic could crash this company to delisting or reverse splits. There’s some chance of a small spike due to the pump or dump.

**$HAPP:**

* Pharma company focused on nutraceutical and dietary supplements.
* The global market share of nutraceutical is at 221.8B (Growth is expected to be 312.6B \~ 41% by 2025) [\[14\]](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/asia-pacific-nutraceuticals-market).
* The Asian market share of dietary supplements is forecasted to reach 8.4% (72.7B) growth by 2025 [\[15\]](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/asia-pacific-dietary-supplement-market). (India is having the greatest growth. ABBOTT is a major player)
* $HAPP is conducting business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, mainly Fijian Happiness [\[16\]](http://www.happ.org.cn/index.php?s=45). 63% Is owned by insiders [\[17\]](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/HAPP).
* Fujian Provincial Health Commission (FPHM) has given permission to let $HAPP produce all types of disinfectants [\[18\]](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/here-s-why-happiness-biotech-happ-investors-are-happy-1028949721).
* IPO locked-up period ends 22 April [\[19\]](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/here-s-why-happiness-biotech-happ-investors-are-happy-1028949721). Could impact the price negatively/positively
* Usual earnings are presented per six months
* The company is currently focusing on making big revenues by making prevention and hygiene products in times of the pandemic [\[20\]](http://www.happ.org.cn/2020-02-25-Happiness-Biotech-Officially-Entered-Into-Disinfectants-Industry).
* Online sales skyrocketed 694% [\[21\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-reports-monthly-online-120000206.html).
* 500.000 masks per week [\[22\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-begun-production-daily-120000946.html).
* 200.000 bottles of hand sanitizers per day [\[23\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-started-exporting-disposable-120000307.html).
* Breakthrough COVID-19 test kits like $AYTU. Now awaiting CFDA, FDA, and CE [\[24\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-announced-breakthrough-developing-120000560.html).
* Plans to expand stores from 10 to 22-30 [\[25\]](https://www.capitalwatch.com/article-3572-1.html).
* Frequent news update
* **Conclusion:** Company is currently doing well in the market; sales are rising and thus revenue will be higher than expected. COVID-19 test kits approvals could cause a pump and dump situation. Long term holding looks great. Just hoping they won’t participate in any fraud like Luckin Coffee. The company is temporary adding a new production line to benefit from the pandemic. This may discourage the original shareholders, but expect them to be ‘happy’ about it (no negative impact of the virus is positive news to any company).

**$OPGN:**

* Pharma company focused on utilizing molecular diagnostics and informatics to help combat infectious diseases [\[26\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OPGN?p=OPGN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* The business model seems to be selling its available information about antibiotic-resistant bacteria to different companies [\[27\]](https://www.opgen.com/about-opgen/).
* The company is unprofitable for years and the chart’s history shows multiple reverse splits [\[26\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OPGN?p=OPGN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* Lately, they are frequently bringing out the news. Consistency in posting updates and other news on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
* **Conclusion:** $OPGN sudden spike a while back ago seems to be caused by a pump or dump. The company should be able to make more revenue in the period of the pandemic. Even now I don't expect the company to be profitable. They’re a great service for the other pharma companies but the current business model will likely drive them into new reverse splits.

**$IDEX:**

* Had their business transformation in 2017 as becoming a fintech company [\[28\]](https://ideanomics.com/about-us/company-milestones/).
* The company had a small amount of revenue in 2019 with negative earnings [\[29\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IDEX?p=IDEX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* The chart shows a downward direction over time; likely to get delisted or another reverse split.
* They also had their spike recently.
* **Conclusion:** Even though the stock price is around an all-time low, the business won’t be profitable any time soon. Might take bankruptcy into account in time of the pandemic or at least more debt. Many red flags for this company; I won’t take my shot in this one.

**$SSY:**

* Could not load their website --&gt; [\[Website\]](http://www.sunlinkhealth.com/) Perhaps you can.
* Found the [‘tech’ website](https://www.sunlinkhealthtech.com/about/), which stated that the company focused on serving the industry’s IT needs and creating an optimized customer experience.
* The company is based in Atlanta.
* Atlanta announced $7M in emergency funding to address COVID-19 [\[30\]](https://www.wabe.org/as-homeless-test-positive-for-covid-19-atlanta-rolls-out-new-measures/).
* The stock price spiked when the stock went over $0.75 [\[31\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ssy)
* The company is making less revenue than the previous years. The yearly earnings are negative. They don’t have free cash flow [\[32\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SSY/cash-flow?p=SSY).
* No interesting PRs or social media.
* **Conclusion:** The company could benefit from the pandemic if healthcare is in need of new IT-devices. The emergency fund could benefit $SSY. I doubt this will happen. The stock doesn’t rely on the news since there are no interesting PRs or social media updates. I guess that the stock is going up just because people are judging the chart and hyping each other up.

**$RMTI:**

* Biopharma company initial focus is the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD, i.e. last stage of kidney disease). They also provide dialysis and anemia treatment [\[33\]](https://www.rockwellmed.com/about-rockwell-medical/).
* The company is developed and commercialized its only product ‘Dialysate Triferic’ (DT). Currently, they had filed a New Drug Application (NDA) on March 28, 2020. The new product has a different formulation than DT and is called ‘I.V. Triferic’. They also actively doing researches about new applications for DT [\[34\]](https://www.rockwellmed.com/bio-pharma-development/).
* DT is a drug that is indicated for iron replacement and hemoglobin in adult hemodialysis patients [\[35\]](https://www.triferic.com/).
* $RMTI produces revenue but yet has negative earnings. The value of negative earnings is increasing each year. So does the revenue [\[36\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RMTI/balance-sheet?p=RMTI).
* On March 17, 2020, the company agreed to loan $35M from ‘Innovatus’ to create more flexibility when working towards the advancement of Triferic [\[37\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-inc-announces-35-105010923.html).
* **Conclusion:** $RMTI is aiming to become profitable. Unfortunately, this will take a while since the amount of negative earning is only increasing each year. The commercialization of Triferic and loan agreements are holding the company together. I won’t be surprised if the stock price is going downwards. I also don’t expect the stock price to have a sudden rise. The FDA approval for the second product I.V. Triferic could raise this stock a bit higher. No positive change in the quarter earnings after the commercialization of I.V. Triferic will decrease the stock price for sure.

**$ZSAN:**

* Pharma company focused on enabling the system (body) administration of bioactive molecules by using the proprietary intracutaneous microneedle patch system.
* The body absorbs 3 times faster the drug when injected by their microneedle patch system [\[38\]](https://www.zosanopharma.com/technology/).
* The FDA accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) of Qtrypta, the first product of $ZSAN [\[39\]](https://www.zosanopharma.com/about/).
* Qtrypta is an acute treatment for migraines (especially cluster headache) [\[40\]](https://www.zosanopharma.com/pipeline/migraine/).
* The goal for the FDA approval is set for Oct 20, 2020 [\[41\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zosano-pharma-announces-fda-acceptance-130010898.html).
* Produces zero revenue, but passed the previous three earnings estimation (Q2, Q3 and Q4 2019) [\[42\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZSAN/cash-flow?p=ZSAN).
* No frequent news or updates.
* **Conclusion:** $ZSAN has no short term upcoming news we should look out for. Probably the hype is caused by fake rumors and people trying to squeeze in. The FDA approval will take place on Oct 20, 2020; this could lead to their best possible spike this year. The negative outcome will push the stock price further down. Might cause a reverse split. News about Direct Public Offering or delisting could arise in the near future. In my opinion, $ZSAN has the potential to grow when the FDA approves its first commercial product. Right now, the stock has more chance to decrease in stock price. Don’t jump in or get out if you’re already in or hold the bag if you believe in this company.

**$GHSI:**

* Pharma company focused on novel treatments for early detection, intervention, and monitoring of eye diseases [\[43\]](https://guardionhealth.com/about/).
* Will get delisted if they don’t regain $1 for 10 consecutive business days by 14 Sept 2020 [\[44\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guardion-health-sciences-granted-180-160557957.html).
* Nothing mentioned about COVID-19
* The hype is about the new product ‘acuMMUNE’ release, which could already be bought at the site of their wholly-owned subsidiaries Nutriguard [\[45\]](https://store.nutriguard.com/search?q=acummune&amp;adv=false&amp;cid=0&amp;isc=false&amp;pf=&amp;pt=&amp;sid=false).
* Initial order form Malaysian company to use $GHSI’s proprietary formula. The order price is $875.000 and the order date is at 30 June 2020 [\[46\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guardion-health-sciences-receives-initial-110010348.html).
* $GHSI’s pipeline has 6 products in its portfolio [\[47\]](https://guardionhealth.com/portfolio/).
* According to Yahoo Finance, there’s a growing pattern of revenues (last year was $903K) but yet they have small negative earnings [\[48\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GHSI/financials?p=GHSI).
* Do not post frequent news or updates on social media.
* **Conclusion:** acuMMUNE could be that one extra product to finally break the streak of negative earnings for $GHSI. Once they announce the availability of this product, the stock will spike. How much the news will hit is not certain to me since consumers could already buy this product at the website of Nutriguard, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of $GHSI. The big spike should be from the quarter earnings of $GHSI. Only if the earnings report a positive income. Get in and get out after the news. In my opinion, positive earnings will set the company’s support line at a higher worth (\~$1).

**$HTBX:**

* Pharma company focused on tackling pathogenic or cancer antigens with their proprietary gp96 platform [\[49\]](https://www.heatbio.com/about).
* Product ‘HS-110’-phase 2 almost is near its end (first product) [\[50\]](https://www.heatbio.com/product-pipeline)
* Doing all they can to research for a COVID-19 vaccine [\[51\]](https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/university-of-miami-working-to-develop-vaccine/?fbclid=IwAR12BQ238KuvxuyTjit_fZRujLuOH4Ir9aVevaZ525Zl1qrz1tJDQMPTnUo).
* Frequently posting updates and news.
* Under $1 stock. Potential to exceed $1 mark anytime with the current COVID-19 vaccine hype.
* Been awarded the CPRIT Grant of 15.2M to fund a phase-1 clinical trial for their new product ‘PTX-35’ [\[52\]](https://www.heatbio.com/product-pipeline/ptx-35).
* Raised over $25M for pipeline development recently [\[53\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/htbx-25m-cash-advance-portfolio-194500617.html).
* Activating T-cells to destroy cancer cells is subjected to be a ‘discovery to treat all cancer’ [\[54\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51182451).
* Massive negative earnings for years compared to their current revenue (-$20M vs. $3M).
* **Conclusion:** $HTBX has the potential to be profitable looking at their current pipeline; the first product HS-110 is at the end of phase II. But I won’t expect this to be the case any time soon. Earnings are looking bad and they still have to go through phase III. Now that they put their focus on a COVID-19 vaccine, more positive news could bring the stock price up: pump and dump.

**$OGEN:**

* Pharma company focused on oral mucositis (a common complication of chemotherapy) and developing novel antibiotics against infectious diseases [\[55\]](https://www.oragenics.com/about).
* Oral mucositis isn’t treatable; currently, doctors recommend prevention by brushing or prescribe painkillers and wait till the bacteria (which causes the disease) dies [\[56\]](https://oralcancerfoundation.org/complications/mucositis/).
* Their products ‘OG716’ and ‘AG013’ are at the end of the preclinical and phase 2, respectively [\[57\]](https://www.oragenics.com/technology-pipeline).
* $OGEN doesn’t participate in the COVID-19 hype.
* No frequent news updates nor social media.
* **Conclusion:** $OGEN’s products are near the end of their phases. The possible good news could pump the stock price up; it will definitely be a victim of the pump or dump. Bad news could dramatically decrease the stock. Since the company doesn’t mention anything about developing a product in relation to COVID-19, there could be a massive pump when they unexpectedly report this. I highly doubt they will. If you expect positive news for both products, get in and get out when peaked.

I spent a lot of work into this. Let me know if you find it useful and who knows I may bring out new DD's in the upcoming future. Happy trading and let the tendies rain upon your unwashed skin!",None,1586787504,4368,,NEGATIVE,0.9826651811599731
OPGN,"Watch out for these stocks $IBIO, $OPGN and more!","# Another week, another chance to get f*cked.

To minimalize my chances for screwing up big time, I've done some DD's over the weekend. The stocks are summed below and you may decide whether to jump in or let it pass.

I'm not an expert nor a professional. Take my opinions with a grain of salt. It's always recommended to do your own research and stand behind your own decisions. 

&amp;#x200B;

**$IBIO:**

* Pharma company focused on providing product development and manufacturing services for third parties [\[1\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBIO?p=IBIO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* Their fast pharming platform shortens the timeline of production and has a large production capacity [\[2\]](https://www.ibioinc.com/pipeline).
* On Feb 03, 2020, $IBIO initiate a joint development with CC-pharming from Beijing [\[3\]](https://ir.ibioinc.com/press-releases/detail/120/ibio-and-cc-pharming-initiate-joint-development-of).
* The COVID-19 vaccine is at the beginning of its pre-clinical stage.
* The company has three other products, of which two are in the beginning stage of pre-clinical, in development. The classical swine fever is at its late-stage before product registration [\[2\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBIO?p=IBIO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* $IBIO’s past shows great success around 2010. This was also a pump or dump. The stock went from $0.20 to $6. Since then the stock went downwards and resulted in a reverse split [\[4\]](https://seekingalpha.com/article/251696-ibio-overvalued).
* A week ago, they announced a collaboration with the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) in which they want to advance the development of the vaccine [\[5\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibio-expands-covid-19-vaccine-113010653.html). The IDRI is a nonprofit and is known to have a deeper understanding of infectious diseases and vaccine development [\[6\]](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/education-training/phd-pathobiology/infectious-disease-research-institute).
* News are released frequently.
* **Conclusion**: $IBIO is on board to create a possible COVID-19 vaccine. Their fast pharming platform and previous collaborations could increase the stock value in the near term. A positive announcement about the COVID-19 development may come within three weeks. I’m bullish on the company. Long term holding (until the pandemic is gone) might not be a great idea if we’re looking at their current balance sheet and chart history.

**$DYNT:**

* Health care company designing, manufacturing and marketing orthopedics, physical therapy, rehabilitation, pain management and athletic training products in the USA and internationally [\[7\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DYNT?p=DYNT).
* The company produces $60M+ yearly in revenue. The earnings are barely negative but is steadily increasing each year.
* Whilst unprofitable, $DYNT has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years if it maintains its current positive free cash flow [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-dynt/dynatronics#cash-runway).
* Although $DYNT is a healthcare stock, COVID-19 has a negative impact on the sales of $DYNT [\[9\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dynatronics-corporation-provides-preliminary-third-113000355.html).
* No frequent PR
* Some monthly activity on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook
* At an all-time low.
* New chief financial officer (CFO) [\[10\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dynatronics-appoints-john-krier-chief-140000420.html).
* Chart history shows that the stock is well-known for its sudden spikes [\[11\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dynt).
* **Conclusion:** $DYNT has a wide variety of products in different healthcare fields. The company is making acceptable negative earnings, and can withstand their business for more than 3 years; it could likely survive the backlash caused by the virus. They recently have a new CFO, trying to adapt to the current situation and are looking forward to increasing revenue. In my opinion, the stock is a buy and has a high likelihood to bounce back over the $1.

**$ZOM:**

* Pharma company for animals (dogs, cats, and horses) [\[12\]](https://zomedica.com/).
* No revenues or product [\[13\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZOM/financials?p=ZOM).
* Low price, but will likely go through a reverse split or get delisted.
* Not regularly bringing out the news.
* **Conclusion:** Company is at its all-time low. Not going to be a profitable company in the short term. A pandemic could crash this company to delisting or reverse splits. There’s some chance of a small spike due to the pump or dump.

**$HAPP:**

* Pharma company focused on nutraceutical and dietary supplements.
* The global market share of nutraceutical is at 221.8B (Growth is expected to be 312.6B \~ 41% by 2025) [\[14\]](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/asia-pacific-nutraceuticals-market).
* The Asian market share of dietary supplements is forecasted to reach 8.4% (72.7B) growth by 2025 [\[15\]](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/asia-pacific-dietary-supplement-market). (India is having the greatest growth. ABBOTT is a major player)
* $HAPP is conducting business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, mainly Fijian Happiness [\[16\]](http://www.happ.org.cn/index.php?s=45). 63% Is owned by insiders [\[17\]](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/HAPP).
* Fujian Provincial Health Commission (FPHM) has given permission to let $HAPP produce all types of disinfectants [\[18\]](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/here-s-why-happiness-biotech-happ-investors-are-happy-1028949721).
* IPO locked-up period ends 22 April [\[19\]](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/here-s-why-happiness-biotech-happ-investors-are-happy-1028949721). Could impact the price negatively/positively
* Usual earnings are presented per six months
* The company is currently focusing on making big revenues by making prevention and hygiene products in times of the pandemic [\[20\]](http://www.happ.org.cn/2020-02-25-Happiness-Biotech-Officially-Entered-Into-Disinfectants-Industry).
* Online sales skyrocketed 694% [\[21\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-reports-monthly-online-120000206.html).
* 500.000 masks per week [\[22\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-begun-production-daily-120000946.html).
* 200.000 bottles of hand sanitizers per day [\[23\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-started-exporting-disposable-120000307.html).
* Breakthrough COVID-19 test kits like $AYTU. Now awaiting CFDA, FDA, and CE [\[24\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happiness-biotech-announced-breakthrough-developing-120000560.html).
* Plans to expand stores from 10 to 22-30 [\[25\]](https://www.capitalwatch.com/article-3572-1.html).
* Frequent news update
* **Conclusion:** Company is currently doing well in the market; sales are rising and thus revenue will be higher than expected. COVID-19 test kits approvals could cause a pump and dump situation. Long term holding looks great. Just hoping they won’t participate in any fraud like Luckin Coffee. The company is temporary adding a new production line to benefit from the pandemic. This may discourage the original shareholders, but expect them to be ‘happy’ about it (no negative impact of the virus is positive news to any company).

**$OPGN:**

* Pharma company focused on utilizing molecular diagnostics and informatics to help combat infectious diseases [\[26\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OPGN?p=OPGN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* The business model seems to be selling its available information about antibiotic-resistant bacteria to different companies [\[27\]](https://www.opgen.com/about-opgen/).
* The company is unprofitable for years and the chart’s history shows multiple reverse splits [\[26\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OPGN?p=OPGN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* Lately, they are frequently bringing out the news. Consistency in posting updates and other news on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
* **Conclusion:** $OPGN sudden spike a while back ago seems to be caused by a pump or dump. The company should be able to make more revenue in the period of the pandemic. Even now I don't expect the company to be profitable. They’re a great service for the other pharma companies but the current business model will likely drive them into new reverse splits.

**$IDEX:**

* Had their business transformation in 2017 as becoming a fintech company [\[28\]](https://ideanomics.com/about-us/company-milestones/).
* The company had a small amount of revenue in 2019 with negative earnings [\[29\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IDEX?p=IDEX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch).
* The chart shows a downward direction over time; likely to get delisted or another reverse split.
* They also had their spike recently.
* **Conclusion:** Even though the stock price is around an all-time low, the business won’t be profitable any time soon. Might take bankruptcy into account in time of the pandemic or at least more debt. Many red flags for this company; I won’t take my shot in this one.

**$SSY:**

* Could not load their website --&gt; [\[Website\]](http://www.sunlinkhealth.com/) Perhaps you can.
* Found the [‘tech’ website](https://www.sunlinkhealthtech.com/about/), which stated that the company focused on serving the industry’s IT needs and creating an optimized customer experience.
* The company is based in Atlanta.
* Atlanta announced $7M in emergency funding to address COVID-19 [\[30\]](https://www.wabe.org/as-homeless-test-positive-for-covid-19-atlanta-rolls-out-new-measures/).
* The stock price spiked when the stock went over $0.75 [\[31\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ssy)
* The company is making less revenue than the previous years. The yearly earnings are negative. They don’t have free cash flow [\[32\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SSY/cash-flow?p=SSY).
* No interesting PRs or social media.
* **Conclusion:** The company could benefit from the pandemic if healthcare is in need of new IT-devices. The emergency fund could benefit $SSY. I doubt this will happen. The stock doesn’t rely on the news since there are no interesting PRs or social media updates. I guess that the stock is going up just because people are judging the chart and hyping each other up.

**$RMTI:**

* Biopharma company initial focus is the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD, i.e. last stage of kidney disease). They also provide dialysis and anemia treatment [\[33\]](https://www.rockwellmed.com/about-rockwell-medical/).
* The company is developed and commercialized its only product ‘Dialysate Triferic’ (DT). Currently, they had filed a New Drug Application (NDA) on March 28, 2020. The new product has a different formulation than DT and is called ‘I.V. Triferic’. They also actively doing researches about new applications for DT [\[34\]](https://www.rockwellmed.com/bio-pharma-development/).
* DT is a drug that is indicated for iron replacement and hemoglobin in adult hemodialysis patients [\[35\]](https://www.triferic.com/).
* $RMTI produces revenue but yet has negative earnings. The value of negative earnings is increasing each year. So does the revenue [\[36\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RMTI/balance-sheet?p=RMTI).
* On March 17, 2020, the company agreed to loan $35M from ‘Innovatus’ to create more flexibility when working towards the advancement of Triferic [\[37\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-medical-inc-announces-35-105010923.html).
* **Conclusion:** $RMTI is aiming to become profitable. Unfortunately, this will take a while since the amount of negative earning is only increasing each year. The commercialization of Triferic and loan agreements are holding the company together. I won’t be surprised if the stock price is going downwards. I also don’t expect the stock price to have a sudden rise. The FDA approval for the second product I.V. Triferic could raise this stock a bit higher. No positive change in the quarter earnings after the commercialization of I.V. Triferic will decrease the stock price for sure.

**$ZSAN:**

* Pharma company focused on enabling the system (body) administration of bioactive molecules by using the proprietary intracutaneous microneedle patch system.
* The body absorbs 3 times faster the drug when injected by their microneedle patch system [\[38\]](https://www.zosanopharma.com/technology/).
* The FDA accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) of Qtrypta, the first product of $ZSAN [\[39\]](https://www.zosanopharma.com/about/).
* Qtrypta is an acute treatment for migraines (especially cluster headache) [\[40\]](https://www.zosanopharma.com/pipeline/migraine/).
* The goal for the FDA approval is set for Oct 20, 2020 [\[41\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zosano-pharma-announces-fda-acceptance-130010898.html).
* Produces zero revenue, but passed the previous three earnings estimation (Q2, Q3 and Q4 2019) [\[42\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZSAN/cash-flow?p=ZSAN).
* No frequent news or updates.
* **Conclusion:** $ZSAN has no short term upcoming news we should look out for. Probably the hype is caused by fake rumors and people trying to squeeze in. The FDA approval will take place on Oct 20, 2020; this could lead to their best possible spike this year. The negative outcome will push the stock price further down. Might cause a reverse split. News about Direct Public Offering or delisting could arise in the near future. In my opinion, $ZSAN has the potential to grow when the FDA approves its first commercial product. Right now, the stock has more chance to decrease in stock price. Don’t jump in or get out if you’re already in or hold the bag if you believe in this company.

**$GHSI:**

* Pharma company focused on novel treatments for early detection, intervention, and monitoring of eye diseases [\[43\]](https://guardionhealth.com/about/).
* Will get delisted if they don’t regain $1 for 10 consecutive business days by 14 Sept 2020 [\[44\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guardion-health-sciences-granted-180-160557957.html).
* Nothing mentioned about COVID-19
* The hype is about the new product ‘acuMMUNE’ release, which could already be bought at the site of their wholly-owned subsidiaries Nutriguard [\[45\]](https://store.nutriguard.com/search?q=acummune&amp;adv=false&amp;cid=0&amp;isc=false&amp;pf=&amp;pt=&amp;sid=false).
* Initial order form Malaysian company to use $GHSI’s proprietary formula. The order price is $875.000 and the order date is at 30 June 2020 [\[46\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guardion-health-sciences-receives-initial-110010348.html).
* $GHSI’s pipeline has 6 products in its portfolio [\[47\]](https://guardionhealth.com/portfolio/).
* According to Yahoo Finance, there’s a growing pattern of revenues (last year was $903K) but yet they have small negative earnings [\[48\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GHSI/financials?p=GHSI).
* Do not post frequent news or updates on social media.
* **Conclusion:** acuMMUNE could be that one extra product to finally break the streak of negative earnings for $GHSI. Once they announce the availability of this product, the stock will spike. How much the news will hit is not certain to me since consumers could already buy this product at the website of Nutriguard, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of $GHSI. The big spike should be from the quarter earnings of $GHSI. Only if the earnings report a positive income. Get in and get out after the news. In my opinion, positive earnings will set the company’s support line at a higher worth (\~$1).

**$HTBX:**

* Pharma company focused on tackling pathogenic or cancer antigens with their proprietary gp96 platform [\[49\]](https://www.heatbio.com/about).
* Product ‘HS-110’-phase 2 almost is near its end (first product) [\[50\]](https://www.heatbio.com/product-pipeline)
* Doing all they can to research for a COVID-19 vaccine [\[51\]](https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/university-of-miami-working-to-develop-vaccine/?fbclid=IwAR12BQ238KuvxuyTjit_fZRujLuOH4Ir9aVevaZ525Zl1qrz1tJDQMPTnUo).
* Frequently posting updates and news.
* Under $1 stock. Potential to exceed $1 mark anytime with the current COVID-19 vaccine hype.
* Been awarded the CPRIT Grant of 15.2M to fund a phase-1 clinical trial for their new product ‘PTX-35’ [\[52\]](https://www.heatbio.com/product-pipeline/ptx-35).
* Raised over $25M for pipeline development recently [\[53\]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/htbx-25m-cash-advance-portfolio-194500617.html).
* Activating T-cells to destroy cancer cells is subjected to be a ‘discovery to treat all cancer’ [\[54\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51182451).
* Massive negative earnings for years compared to their current revenue (-$20M vs. $3M).
* **Conclusion:** $HTBX has the potential to be profitable looking at their current pipeline; the first product HS-110 is at the end of phase II. But I won’t expect this to be the case any time soon. Earnings are looking bad and they still have to go through phase III. Now that they put their focus on a COVID-19 vaccine, more positive news could bring the stock price up: pump and dump.

**$OGEN:**

* Pharma company focused on oral mucositis (a common complication of chemotherapy) and developing novel antibiotics against infectious diseases [\[55\]](https://www.oragenics.com/about).
* Oral mucositis isn’t treatable; currently, doctors recommend prevention by brushing or prescribe painkillers and wait till the bacteria (which causes the disease) dies [\[56\]](https://oralcancerfoundation.org/complications/mucositis/).
* Their products ‘OG716’ and ‘AG013’ are at the end of the preclinical and phase 2, respectively [\[57\]](https://www.oragenics.com/technology-pipeline).
* $OGEN doesn’t participate in the COVID-19 hype.
* No frequent news updates nor social media.
* **Conclusion:** $OGEN’s products are near the end of their phases. The possible good news could pump the stock price up; it will definitely be a victim of the pump or dump. Bad news could dramatically decrease the stock. Since the company doesn’t mention anything about developing a product in relation to COVID-19, there could be a massive pump when they unexpectedly report this. I highly doubt they will. If you expect positive news for both products, get in and get out when peaked.

This one particular company is going to make you some bank the next couple of weeks if not months!

Here’s why I think they’ll profit from this pandemic. 
• They’re submitting their test kits (similar to AYTU’s) for CFDA, CE and FDA approval (this could happen anytime)
• They have a variety of prevention related products in their arsenal (and currently producing and exporting to different countries)
• They’re a Chinese company from origin (and still are). Chinese companies are known to rapidly increase their chance of success when they see an opportunity. WARNING ⚠️: This could also be a downturn if you look at Luckin Coffee (LK).

Akers Biosciences and Premas Biotech Announce Progress in its Vaccine Development for Covid-19

📷[**GlobeNewswire**](http://www.globenewswire.com/)April 6, 2020

* **Successfully obtained clones for all three selected Coronavirus Antigens**  


Thorofare, New Jersey, April 06, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akers Biosciences, Inc. (the “Company”) ([AKER](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aker)), a developer of rapid health information technologies, today announced that its collaboration with Premas Biotech has successfully completed the milestone of obtaining clones of all three coronavirus antigens, Spike (S), Envelope (E), and Membrane (M) that they have selected for their vaccine candidate.

The clone development process has four primary steps including first, the design and synthesis of the genes; second, the selection of the right host; third, the insertion of the gene into the host; and fourth, the verification that the clone has the right gene, and all characteristics are correct.

Prabuddha Kundu, Co-Founder and Managing Director at Premas Biotech, commented, “We are pleased with the successful completion of this phase in the development of our novel vaccine candidate. We believe that our ability to clone all three of these antigens will differentiate our vaccine candidate from others. Specifically, the surface of a virus is what the immune systems sees, and importantly has a multitude of proteins. We are providing the immune system with three shots on goal, instead of one, by including S, E, and M together. This is increasingly important due to the likelihood of protein mutation. If a protein mutates, a vaccine can be rendered non efficacious, a scenario often faced with seasonal flu variations. By including three at one time, the immune system can still recognize the other two antigens, which we believe will enhance its efficacy and assist us in making this vaccine candidate successful.”

Christopher Schreiber, Executive Chairman of Akers, stated, “We believe that we are one step closer to an effective vaccine candidate for the coronavirus pandemic. We have now completed our first important milestone by generating these clones. We also have initiated the second stage in protein expression, which we hope to provide an update on later this month. We are optimistic about the continued success of our partnership with Premas, one that is already starting to bear fruit.”

I honestly think it's about time I just cut my losses and gtfo because I have no other buying power and I just want to make $$ instead of waiting my butt off for something to turn green, which might never happen ffs. Every damn day someone says oh aytu to the freakin moon and it only goes up a few cents and then tanks again so I think it's time for me to just abandon this broken ship and start again. I might've lost 1k but I'm still 2k in profit in my a little over month time on RH, which I guess isn't too bad at the end of the day. You live and learn from the dumb mistakes you make like trusting the hype and then you get back into the green, maybe make more mistakes and go into the red, and then you learn again and bounce back, and the cycle repeats to the point where you rarely make those dumb mistakes.

DUST,"All you need to know about JNUG, JDST, NUGT, DUST, and other leveraged ETFs","I've been seeing a lot of confusion lately, and I know we have a lot of new traders here, so hopefully this is helpful to some of you. Note that this was getting really long, so some of these points aren't all-inclusive, but they should give you a good place to start:

* JNUG (et al.) is a (daily) leveraged ETF. It's not a stock.
   * A stock represents stake in a company. If you own shares of a company's stock, you own a piece of that company.
   * An ETF is like a basket of stocks (and/or other assets). There can be lots of different assets in the basket, and when you own a share of an ETF, you own a piece of the whole basket. Kinda like a bundle of fractional shares.
      * The net value of all the assets in the basket is called the Net Asset Value (NAV). When we talk about NAV, it's usually in the context of ""how much is one share actually worth, vs how much is it being traded for""
* The prices of leveraged ETFs behave differently from unleveraged ('normal') ETFs and stocks
   * Sometimes you can look at a stock and say ""it used to be worth $100, but right now it's only $60. I think the company will recover from the thing that made it drop, so I'll buy at $60 and wait for it to get back to $100."" But **that's not how daily leveraged ETFs work**.
      * The leverage and daily rebalancing (that means the leverage gets 'reset' each day) makes the math wonky when you hold it for multiple days. I could go on and on about this, but the point is even if the underlying index of a leveraged ETF recovers *completely,* the leveraged ETF could still be worth a lot less than it was (i.e. it didn't recover completely).
      * That doesn't mean there aren't gains to be had, it just means that you shouldn't base your price targets on historical prices of leveraged ETFs (unless you're using a model that accounts for the leverage and daily rebalancing).
* The price of JNUG/JDST et al. rarely deviates from it's NAV. Last year, JDST's price was never more than 1% offset from its NAV. This year the market has been real volatile, and we've seen some days with higher deviation, but even this year it's rare to see deviations larger than 1%.
   * That means (roughly) that when the price of JNUG dips, it's not because people are bailing out of JNUG or panic selling or whatever. And when the price jumps, it's not because people are hyping over JNUG. It's because the underlying index (the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index or MVGDXJTR) dropped/rose.
* JNUG and JDST are inverse of each other. If you think MVGDXJTR (i.e. junior gold mining stocks) will go up, jump into JNUG (the 3X daily bull ETF), and if you think it will go down, jump into JDST (the 3X daily bear ETF).
   * Don't hold them both at the same time
* JNUG/JDST are **daily** ETFs. Their leverage is accurate to a single day, and they aren't generally recommended to be held longer than a day. 
   * Multi-day holds are sometimes manageable, and can be very lucrative, but they come with additional risks that you should be aware of.
   * In particular, you should understand the patterns in the underlying index that would cause JNUG to rise or fall, in addition to how volatility affects the price of JNUG.
* Leveraged ETFs are especially volatile. Their purpose, after all, is to provide additional leverage on the underlying index.
   * 300% means if the underlying goes up 10%, then the leveraged ETF is supposed to go up 30%. If the underlying goes down 10%, the ETF goes down 30%.
* For an unleveraged alternative, look at $GDXJ. You'll notice the day charts of GDXJ and JNUG look almost identical, but JNUG is more exaggerated. That's because they follow the same index, but JNUG is leveraged
   * JNUG is actually composed (usually, but this isn't guaranteed) of $GDXJ and derivatives, in order to provide 300% leverage
* This isn't terrible news or anything, but JNUG and JDST (lots of Direxion ETFs, actually) are switching from 300% to 200% leverage on March 31. They were going to be switched on May 19, but that got moved up.",None,1585357069,4685,,NEGATIVE,0.9897258877754211

JDST,"A Little JNUG &amp; JDST Clarification (Should You Hold Through The Weekend, Closing Price, etc.)","Just in case you're confused about a few things or wondering why JNUG will fall and then spike, whether or not you should hold through the weekend, or just are curious about this thing because people keep blasting it all over this sub. This is for you.

* THIS is an ETF which means the price of JNUG tracks something else. It's not a typical stock. However, as it falls stop losses are being triggered and orders being filled. People are scooping up these cheaper shares at much lower prices (JNUG also tracks GDXJ so it's possible it's fallen as low as it will but I highly doubt it). JNUG is already down 20% today which I think is more than yesterday. 4.50 is the next big wall. After each wall is broken, there is some pullback and then what I believe will be continuous dips throughout the day (unless the stimulus bill is signed)
* Should you hold into the weekend? IMO, HECK NO. RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM THAT DECISION.  This is NOT a hold into the weekend. This is a leveraged ETF and even Dixerion says it's super volatile. While we may see $2.80 or 2.50 or whatever people want to throw out as a high number what's most important is people take their profits where they want and don't get greedy. In reality (imo), JNUG will have a HUGE drop off EOD right before close because people won't want to hold over the weekend and THEN and only then will JDST holders touch the moon. That is an opinion backed by last Friday's chart which saw JNUG dip an hour before close and then ROCKET to 3.90
* Where do I think it'll close? This is just a guess, but I think it definitely breaks 2.50 and closes somewhere around 2.75. And if it rockets into oblivion 3.25. Just my predictions and opinions.
* Lastly, once JDST has seen its hayday, JUMP SHIP TO JNUG. These two play off each other so when one is at it's highest, the other is at its lowest (which is how I averaged JDST at 1.72 a share)

AGRX,Why you should invest in $AGRX now:,"Agile Therapeutics ($AGRX) is a pharmaceutical company and has one product: Twirla. It was FDA approved in mid February 2020. Unfortunately, stock price has gone down due to stock dilutions and the CV outbreak, along with the fact that the FDA approval was baked into the stock price. 

On StockTwits, user super\_marioo wrote:

*"" okay since I heard someone mention BO i'll share my thoughts again. i know posters on other beaten down stocks scream &amp; hope for BO out of desperation but a few minutes of research and you notice - insider selling or product was PIII approved but still needs years and $ to submit NDA &amp; receive FDA approval. AGRX is diff and is a prime buy-out target! min of $8 in March or April is my guess.*   

*1. Agile has expertise in developing products - not sales &amp; marketing* 

*2. FDA approved product with big market share potential* 

*3. Big pharma already have sales &amp; marketing teams, doctor connections, etc and can launch Twirla much sooner* 

*4. Cheaper for big pharma to buy an FDA approved product instead of developing one that may take 5-10 years*  

*5. CFO recently hired has sold last 3 prior companies* 

*6. CEO also has a history of selling companies* 

*7. Insider buying - quite a bit last 6 weeks* 

*8. Big cash position for negotiation leverage. the timing of the cash raise suspect &amp; had a BO taste ""*

and also wrote:

*"" a bad market is good timing for an acquisition. you are a penny flipper &amp; can't see beyond tomorrow. ofcourse they can sell the product - it's free with affordable care act and the CHC market is growing YOY. big pharma's growth strategy is m&amp;a's not holding onto cash!""*

Analyst forecasts range from $6 - $15. As long as you hold tight onto this stock, you should eventually make a profit if a BO happens :))

GNUS,$GNUS Due Diligence,"This stock is poised to double - if not a triple- in this stocks price in the coming week to month. 

Catalysts on the Horizon: 

1) Conference call Friday at 10:00 am CST with an update to the business strategy, roll out of their merchandise and the biggest of all - 

2) The planned release of their new show: Stan Lee's Super Kindergarten starring Arnold  Schwarzenegger. 

Background on the second one: ""Partnership was formed between Genius Brands and the Alibaba Company of China.  Alibaba, China’s largest company,  will co-produce *Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten* with us, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as distribute, promote, and oversee licensing of consumer products and merchandising in China.""

To add to that they just announced that one of their core shows Rainbow Rangers had the amount of airings per week increased to 26 by Nickelodeon. 

With coronavirus grounding people at home, you can imagine the viewership of these shows is only bound to increase. Once Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten hits the airwaves, the upside will finally be realized. Tapping the US market is a start, having the product co-produced and distributed to China is pure rocket fuel. 

I do currently own shares and intend to see it through the conference and the release of one of their soon to be flagship products.

JNUG,$JNUG,"$JNUG is a 3x leveraged ETF on Junior Gold and Silver Mining companies in developed and emerging markets. Doesn't exactly follow gold and silver commodity prices, but a mix of commodity prices and markets overall. Right now it's down a crazy amount, and I usually never post here but it's getting in to penny stock territory so I thought I'd say something. In at 3.71. Disclaimer: This is a 3x levered ETF so it is a very complex tool that you should try to understand before you invest in it. It tracks an index and then amplifies that index's return. So if the index moves 2% it will move 6%. Just something to think about. It's very volatile and has a lot of volume and I think that is something people here value (liquidity and volatility).
